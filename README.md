## LLM-Based Code Generation for Optimized Quantum Circuits

This repository contains the code for the paper [Fine-Tuning Large Language Models on Quantum Optimization Problems for Circuit Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11109).
In addition to this, it also serves as the source code for the author's thesis.

# Generated from: Quantum Simulation
# Qubits: 3
 qubits: q0, q1, q2

Wait, the qubits are labeled as q0, q1, q2.

In QASM, the qubit ordering is q[0], q[1], q[2], so in Cirq, it would be q0, q1, q2.

We need to take care of the ordering and the gates.

CNOT gates in QASM are represented by CNOT, and in Cirq, they are cnot.

So, we need to go through each gate in the QASM code and convert them into the appropriate Cirq gates.

So, the process would be:

For each gate in the QASM code:

1. Identify the gate type and its parameters.

2. Convert the gate into Cirq's equivalent gate.

3. Apply the gate to the appropriate qubits in the correct order.

But in the QASM code, the order of qubits is q[0], q[1], q[2], so in Cirq, it would be q0, q1, q2.

Wait, no. Wait, in Qasm, the qubits are ordered q[0], q[1], q[2]. But when applying a gate in Qasm, it's written as gate q[i], q[j], which is qubit j, then i.

Wait, actually, in Qasm, the qubit ordering is q[0], q[1], q[2], so when applying a gate like "u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2]", it's applying it to qubit q[2], which is the third qubit.

Wait, so in the code, "u3" is a unitary matrix, and in Qasm, the order is q[0], q[1], q[2]. So for a u3 gate, the first argument is the angle for q0, the second for q1, the third for q2.

Similarly, the cz gate is controlled on q[1], target q[2], which in Cirq would be cz(q1, q2).

Wait, but in Cirq, the ordering is the same as the labels? Or does the ordering matter?

Wait, in Cirq, the qubits are q0, q1, q2, and when applying a gate to qubits q1 and q2, you need to make sure the order is correct. For example, in Qasm, cz q[1], q[2] is a controlled-z with control q1, target q2. In Cirq, it's cnot(q1, q2) or cz(q1, q2). Wait, wait: cnot is CNOT gate, which is controlled-x. cz is controlled-z. So, in Qasm, cz is the controlled-z gate, same as cZ in Cirq. So, yes, cz(q1, q2) in Cirq would correspond to cz q[1], q[2] in Qasm.

Similarly, for the u3 gates. Let's take an example.

In Qasm: u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0]; That's a unitary matrix where q0 is being acted on with angles pi/2, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2. Wait, no: wait, the u3 gate is a 3x3 matrix, which can be written as a product of three rotations around different axes. The first angle corresponds to the rotation on q0, the second on q1, the third on q2.

Wait, but in Qasm, when you apply a u3 gate to q[0], it's only acting on q0, because the other qubits (q1 and q2) are not specified. Hmm, wait, no: when you have a gate like u3(θ1, θ2, θ3), it's a three-qubit gate. So, it's applying a rotation around the x-axis to q0 by θ1, a rotation around the y-axis to q1 by θ2, and a rotation around the z-axis to q2 by θ3. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, actually, I think I need to double-check the Qasm documentation for the u3 gate. From what I recall, u3(θ1, θ2, θ3) applies a rotation on q0, q1, q2 with angles θ1, θ2, θ3 respectively. So, for each qubit, it's a rotation about an axis determined by the order of the angles. So, for q0, it's the x-axis (since the first parameter is the x-axis angle), q1 is y-axis, q2 is z-axis? Or maybe it's arbitrary. I think the axes cycle through x, y, z, so the first angle is x for q0, second is y for q1, third is z for q2.

Wait, actually, in Qasm, the unitary gate u3 is defined as follows: it's a 3-qubit gate where each qubit is subject to a rotation about a different axis. The first qubit (q[0]) is rotated about the x-axis, the second (q[1]) about the y-axis, and the third (q[2]) about the z-axis, each by the respective angles provided.

So, for example, u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0]; applies a rotation of pi/2 about x to q0, 3pi/2 about y to q1, and 3pi/2 about z to q2.

In Cirq, the equivalent gate would be a three-qubit gate that does the same. However, Cirq doesn't have a built-in u3 gate, but you can represent it using a custom three-qubit gate, or using a combination of existing gates. But since the user wants to use standard Cirq gates, perhaps we can represent u3 as a product of rotations. Because the u3 gate can be written as a product of three rotations: Rx, Ry, Rz with the specified angles.

Wait, but in the example, the angles are for x, y, z rotations respectively. So, the u3 gate can be expressed as Rx(theta1) * Ry(theta2) * Rz(theta3), where the order of multiplication matters because quantum operations are applied from right to left. So, the rotation on q0 is first, then q1, then q2. So, the overall gate would be Rz(theta3) * Ry(theta2) * Rx(theta1), acting on the qubits in reverse order.

Wait, that's important. Because in quantum mechanics, the operations are applied from the right, so when you have multiple qubits, the rightmost qubit is acted on first. So, for a three-qubit gate, the gate is applied as g = A⊗B⊗C, and when applying it to q0, q1, q2, you do C(B(A( |ψ> )) ), so the rightmost operation is applied first.

So, if we have a u3 gate with angles theta_x, theta_y, theta_z for q0, q1, q2 respectively, then in terms of Cirq gates, it's equivalent to applying Rx(theta_x) to q0, Ry(theta_y) to q1, Rz(theta_z) to q2. But because of the ordering, the overall gate is Rz(theta_z) * Ry(theta_y) * Rx(theta_x) applied to the qubits in the order q0, q1, q2.

Wait, no. Because the gate is applied as (Rz(theta_z) * Ry(theta_y) * Rx(theta_x)) ) ⊗ I⊗I on the three qubits. So, for q0, you have Rx(theta_x), for q1 Ry(theta_y), for q2 Rz(theta_z). So when you apply the gate to q0, q1, q2, you do: Rx(theta_x) on q0, then Ry(theta_y) on q1, then Rz(theta_z) on q2. But the way the tensor product works is that the gate is applied as (Rz(theta_z) * Ry(theta_y) * Rx(theta_x)) ) to the three qubits, meaning q2 is acted on first, then q1, then q0.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So, in terms of application order, the gate is applied as:

g = Rz(theta_z) * Ry(theta_y) * Rx(theta_x)

Then, when you apply g to q0, q1, q2, the order is: first apply g to q2, then to q1, then to q0. Because in quantum mechanics, the rightmost operation is applied first.

So, in code, for a u3 gate with angles (x, y, z), the corresponding Cirq code is:

cirq.Rz(x) * cirq.Ry(y) * cirq.Rx(z) applied to q[2], q[1], q[0]. Or is it applied to q0, q1, q2? Wait, no. Because the gate is applied to all three qubits, but in the order q2, q1, q0.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the u3 gate as a three-qubit gate that applies Rx(theta_x) to q0, Ry(theta_y) to q1, Rz(theta_z) to q2. So, the overall operation is the product of the individual operations on each qubit. But in terms of how they're composed, since the operations are applied from right to left, the order is important.

So, the way to represent the u3(theta_x, theta_y, theta_z) gate in Cirq is to create a three-qubit gate where:

- q0 is acted on by Rx(theta_x)
- q1 is acted on by Ry(theta_y)
- q2 is acted on by Rz(theta_z)

Thus, in code, the gate is constructed as:

cirq.Rx(theta_x) @ q0
cirq.Ry(theta_y) @ q1
cirq.Rz(theta_z) @ q2

But in terms of combining these into a single gate, since they are applied to different qubits, the combined gate is the tensor product of these individual operations. So, the overall gate is:

cirq.Rz(theta_z) * cirq.Ry(theta_y) * cirq.Rx(theta_x)

But wait, no, the order is important. Because the operations are applied from the right, so the Rz is applied first, then Ry, then Rx. So, in code, the combined gate is:

cirq.Rz(theta_z) @ q2
cirq.Ry(theta_y) @ q1
cirq.Rx(theta_x) @ q0

So, in the context of the entire circuit, when you apply this gate to the three qubits, you have to make sure that the order of application is correct.

This is getting a bit complicated, but let's try to take an example.

Take the first gate in the Qasm code:

u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2];

In Qasm, this applies a u3 gate to qubit q[2], with angles pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183. So, according to the earlier analysis, the u3 gate applies:

- To q0: Rx(pi/2)
- To q1: Ry(0)
- To q2: Rz(0.17718794780830183)

But since it's applied to q[2], which is q2, the qubits involved are q2 (along with q0 and q1, implicitly). So, in Cirq, this would be:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) @ q0
cirq.Ry(0) @ q1
cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) @ q2

But since in the Qasm code, the gate is applied to q[2], but the u3 gate is a three-qubit gate, it's actually acting on all three qubits, q0, q1, q2. So, in Cirq, you have to make sure that the code reflects that.

Wait, but the code in the problem statement is the Qasm code, and the user wants to convert it to Cirq. So, the Cirq code should have the same effect. So, for each u3 gate in the Qasm code, we have to create a three-qubit gate that applies Rx, Ry, Rz on q0, q1, q2 respectively.

So, for example, the first u3 in Qasm is:

u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2];

Which is equivalent to applying:

- Rx(pi/2) to q0,
- Ry(0) to q1,
- Rz(0.17718794780830183) to q2.

So, in Cirq, this would be:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) * cirq.Ry(0) * cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) applied to q0, q1, q2.

But since the operations are applied from right to left, the order is important. So, the correct way is to have:

g = cirq.Rz(theta_z) * cirq.Ry(theta_y) * cirq.Rx(theta_x)

Then, apply g to q0, q1, q2.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to create a three-qubit gate where:

g = cirq.Rx(theta_x) ⊗ cirq.Ry(theta_y) ⊗ cirq.Rz(theta_z)

Because each qubit is being rotated independently. So, the overall gate is the tensor product of the individual rotations.

Yes, that makes more sense. Because the u3 gate is a product of three separate single-qubit rotations, each applied to a different qubit. So, the overall gate is the tensor product of these three rotations.

So, in Cirq, for the u3 gate with theta_x, theta_y, theta_z, the corresponding gate is:

g = cirq.Rx(theta_x) ⊗ cirq.Ry(theta_y) ⊗ cirq.Rz(theta_z)

Then, when you apply this gate to the three qubits (q0, q1, q2), each qubit is subjected to its respective rotation.

So, for example, the first u3 in the Qasm code is:

u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2];

Which in Cirq would be:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Ry(0) ⊗ cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) q0, q1, q2.

But wait, in Qasm, the gate is applied to q[2], but the u3 gate is a three-qubit gate, so it's implicitly acting on all three qubits. So, in Cirq, the code would need to represent that the gate is applied to all three qubits.

But in the given Qasm code, after u3(...), the next line is cz q[1], q[2]; which is a controlled-z between q1 and q2.

So, in Cirq, that would be cnot(q1, q2), or cz(q1, q2), depending on which gate it is. Wait, Qasm uses cz for controlled-z, which is the same as cZ in Cirq.

So, cz q[1], q[2]; becomes cZ(q1, q2).

Similarly, for the cz gates, it's straightforward.

Another example is later in the code:

cz q[1], q[2];

Which is the same in Cirq: cZ(q1, q2).

Now, considering that, let's go through the code step by step.

The Qasm code starts with:

OPENQASM 3.0;
include "stdgates.inc";

Which is standard for Qasm. But in Cirq, we don't need these lines.

Then, it defines the classical register c as:

bit[3] c;

And the qubits as:

qubit[3] q;

But in Cirq, the classical register and qubits can be ignored since we are only focusing on quantum gates.

Then, the gates are:

u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2];
u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 0.9253564645174989) q[1];
u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0];
cz q[1], q[2];
u3(0.39048419698856807, 0, 0) q[2];
u3(0.39048419698856807, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[1];
cz q[1], q[2];
u3(0.09371734242264666, 3*pi/2, pi/2) q[2];
u3(2.285147266773899, 3*pi/2, pi) q[1];
cz q[0], q[1];
u3(1.0312029416845523, 0, 0) q[1];
u3(1.0312029416845523, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0];
cz q[0], q[1];
u3(0.43180414767462927, 2*pi, 3*pi/2) q[1];
u3(3.0681103418073223, 0, 0) q[0];
cz q[1], q[2];
u3(0.7309297473898185, 0, 0) q[2];
u3(0.7309297473898185, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[1];
cz q[1], q[2];
u3(1.8158888595318605, pi/2, pi/2) q[2];
u3(1.965710121986977, pi/2, 0) q[1];
cz q[0], q[1];
u3(1.0312029416845523, 0, 0) q[1];
u3(1.0312029416845523, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0];
cz q[0], q[1];
u3(2.1417424368226117, 0, pi/2) q[1];
u3(pi/2, 1.1288315380582659, 3*pi/2) q[0];
cz q[1], q[2];
u3(0.39048419698856807, 0, 0) q[2];
u3(0.39048419698856807, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[1];
cz q[1], q[2];
u3(pi/2, 4.378735520627937, 0) q[2];
u3(pi/2, 3.6305670036045803, pi/2) q[1];
c[0] = measure q[0];
c[1] = measure q[1];
c[2] = measure q[2];

So, the gates are a series of u3 gates and cz gates.

Our task is to convert each gate into Cirq code, making sure the qubit ordering is correct.

First, for the u3 gates, each has three angles and is applied to q[0], q[1], q[2] (but sometimes just to a specific qubit in the code, but since it's a three-qubit gate, it's acting on all three). Wait, no: in the code, the u3 is applied to a specific qubit, but since it's a three-qubit gate, it's acting on all three. So in Cirq, each u3 gate is a three-qubit gate acting on q0, q1, q2 with their respective rotations.

Similarly, cz is a two-qubit gate, so in Cirq, it's cZ on the specified qubits.

The measures are at the end, which in Cirq would be classical measurements.

So, the steps are:

1. For each u3 gate in Qasm, create a three-qubit gate in Cirq using Rx, Ry, Rz with the respective angles, in the order of q0, q1, q2.

2. For each cz gate in Qasm, create a two-qubit gate in Cirq using cZ on the specified qubits.

3. After all the gates are applied, add the classical measurements.

But let's start by converting each gate.

Let's take the first few gates:

1. u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2];

As discussed, in Cirq, this is:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Ry(0) ⊗ cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) q0, q1, q2.

But in Cirq, the tensor product is written as:

cirq.Rx(theta_x) ⊗ cirq.Ry(theta_y) ⊗ cirq.Rz(theta_z)

So, the code would be:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Ry(0) ⊗ cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) q0, q1, q2.

But wait, in Cirq, when you apply a gate to multiple qubits, you have to specify them in order. So, the correct way is to apply the gate to q0, q1, q2 in that order.

So, the code would be:

(cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) @ q0) * (cirq.Ry(0) @ q1) * (cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) @ q2)

But since it's a three-qubit gate, you can also represent it as a single gate:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Ry(0) ⊗ cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) q0, q1, q2.

But I think in Cirq, when you have a three-qubit gate, you can apply it directly by passing all qubits.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to create a custom three-qubit gate and apply it to q0, q1, q2.

But for simplicity, since each qubit is being subjected to a single rotation, we can represent the u3 gate as the tensor product of the individual rotations.

So, the code for the first gate is:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Ry(0) ⊗ cirq.Rz(0.17718794780830183) q0, q1, q2.

Similarly, the second gate:

u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 0.9253564645174989) q[1];

This applies to q1, but since it's a three-qubit gate, it's acting on q0, q1, q2. The angles are pi/2 for q0, 3pi/2 for q1, 0.9253564645174989 for q2.

Wait, no: in the u3 gate, the first angle is for q0, second for q1, third for q2. So, for this gate, the angles are pi/2, 3pi/2, 0.9253564645174989.

So, the corresponding Cirq code is:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Ry(3 * math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Rz(0.9253564645174989) q0, q1, q2.

But wait, in the Qasm code, the gate is applied to q[1], which is q1, but since it's a three-qubit gate, it's acting on all three qubits. So, in Cirq, it's the same as above.

Next, the third gate:

u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0];

Angles: pi/2 for q0, 3pi/2 for q1, 3pi/2 for q2.

Cirq code:

cirq.Rx(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Ry(3 * math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Rz(3 * math.pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

Then, cz q[1], q[2]; which is a controlled-z on q1 and q2.

In Cirq, this is cZ(q1, q2).

So, code: cZ(q1, q2).

Next gate:

u3(0.39048419698856807, 0, 0) q[2];

Angles: 0.39048419698856807 for q0, 0 for q1, 0 for q2.

So, in Cirq:

cirq.Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ cirq.Ry(0) ⊗ cirq.Rz(0) q0, q1, q2.

But since Rz(0) is the identity, this simplifies to cirq.Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ identity ⊗ identity applied to q0, q1, q2. So, effectively, it's just cirq.Rx(0.39048419698856807) on q0.

Wait, but in the Qasm code, it's applied to q[2], but the u3 gate is a three-qubit gate. So, in Cirq, it's the same as applying the three-qubit gate, but since Rz(0) is identity, it's the same as just applying Rx on q0, and leaving q1 and q2 as identity.

But in the overall circuit, the qubits are being acted on, so it's correct to represent it as the three-qubit gate.

Similarly, the next gate:

u3(0.39048419698856807, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[1];

Angles: 0.39048419698856807 for q0, pi/2 for q1, 3pi/2 for q2.

Cirq code:

cirq.Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ cirq.Ry(math.pi/2) ⊗ cirq.Rz(3 * math.pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

Next, cz q[1], q[2]; again, cZ(q1, q2).

Continuing this way, each u3 gate is converted into a three-qubit gate with the appropriate Rx, Ry, Rz on q0, q1, q2.

Now, considering that, let's try to write the Cirq code.

First, we need to include the necessary gates. In Cirq, the gates are imported from cirq.gates.

So, we need to import:

from cirq import CNOT, CZ, Rx, Ry, Rz

Then, the code structure would be:

from cirq import CNOT, CZ, Rx, Ry, Rz

# Define the qubits
q0 = cirq.Qubit('q0')
q1 = cirq.Qubit('q1')
q2 = cirq.Qubit('q2')

# Apply the gates
for each gate in the Qasm code:
    if it's a u3 gate:
        theta_x = first angle
        theta_y = second angle
        theta_z = third angle
        gate = (Rx(theta_x) ⊗ Ry(theta_y) ⊗ Rz(theta_z))
        circuit.append(gate)
    elif it's a cz gate:
        control = qubit
        target = next qubit
        circuit.append(CZ(control, target))
    # other gates like CNOT, etc., if any

But in the given code, there are only u3 and cz gates.

So, the code can be written as:

from cirq import CNOT, CZ, Rx, Ry, Rz

q0 = cirq.Qubit('q0')
q1 = cirq.Qubit('q1')
q2 = cirq.Qubit('q2')

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

for gate in qasm_gates:
    if gate.type == 'u3':
        angles = gate.params
        theta_x = angles[0]
        theta_y = angles[1]
        theta_z = angles[2]
        gate_cirq = (Rx(theta_x) @ q0) * (Ry(theta_y) @ q1) * (Rz(theta_z) @ q2)
        circuit.append(gate_cirq)
    elif gate.type == 'cz':
        control, target = gate.qubits
        circuit.append(CZ(control, target))
    # handle other gate types if any

But in the problem, we have to write the code that directly converts the Qasm code to Cirq, without parsing it. So, we have to manually convert each line.

Alternatively, we can write the code step by step.

Looking back at the Qasm code, the gates are:

1. u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2];
2. u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 0.9253564645174989) q[1];
3. u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0];
4. cz q[1], q[2];
5. u3(0.39048419698856807, 0, 0) q[2];
6. u3(0.39048419698856807, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[1];
7. cz q[1], q[2];
8. u3(0.09371734242264666, 3*pi/2, pi/2) q[2];
9. u3(2.285147266773899, 3*pi/2, pi) q[1];
10. cz q[0], q[1];

But since we need to output the code that only includes the quantum gates, the classical register and measures can be ignored.

So, the quantum gates are from lines 1 to 33.

Now, let's process each of these 33 gates.

1. Gate 1: u3(pi/2, 0, 0.17718794780830183) q[2];

Cirq code: Rx(pi/2) ⊗ Ry(0) ⊗ Rz(0.17718794780830183) q0, q1, q2.

But since Ry(0) is identity, this can be simplified as Rx(pi/2) ⊗ I ⊗ Rz(0.17718794780830183), but since the gate is applied to all three qubits, it's better to write it as the three-qubit gate.

So, code: (Rx(pi/2) @ q0) * (Ry(0) @ q1) * (Rz(0.17718794780830183) @ q2)

But in Cirq, you can represent it as a single gate:

g1 = Rx(pi/2) ⊗ Ry(0) ⊗ Rz(0.17718794780830183) q0, q1, q2.

But the code would be:

g1 = (Rx(math.pi/2) @ q0) * (Ry(0) @ q1) * (Rz(0.17718794780830183) @ q2)

Alternatively, since Ry(0) is I, we can write it as:

g1 = (Rx(math.pi/2) @ q0) * identity(q1) * (Rz(0.17718794780830183) @ q2)

But in practice, it's the same as the three-qubit gate.

2. Gate 2: u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 0.9253564645174989) q[1];

Cirq code: Rx(pi/2) ⊗ Ry(3pi/2) ⊗ Rz(0.9253564645174989) q0, q1, q2.

So, same as above.

3. Gate 3: u3(pi/2, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0];

Cirq code: Rx(pi/2) ⊗ Ry(3pi/2) ⊗ Rz(3pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

4. Gate 4: cz q[1], q[2];

Cirq code: CZ(q1, q2).

5. Gate 5: u3(0.39048419698856807, 0, 0) q[2];

Cirq code: Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ Ry(0) ⊗ Rz(0) q0, q1, q2.

Since Ry(0) and Rz(0) are identities, this is equivalent to Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ I ⊗ I, which is just Rx on q0.

But again, written as a three-qubit gate.

6. Gate 6: u3(0.39048419698856807, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[1];

Cirq code: Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ Ry(pi/2) ⊗ Rz(3pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

7. Gate 7: cz q[1], q[2];

Cirq code: CZ(q1, q2).

8. Gate 8: u3(0.09371734242264666, 3*pi/2, pi/2) q[2];

Cirq code: Rx(0.09371734242264666) ⊗ Ry(3pi/2) ⊗ Rz(pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

9. Gate 9: u3(2.285147266773899, 3*pi/2, pi) q[1];

Cirq code: Rx(2.285147266773899) ⊗ Ry(3pi/2) ⊗ Rz(pi) q0, q1, q2.

10. Gate 10: cz q[0], q[1];

Cirq code: Rx(1.965710121986977) ⊗ Ry(pi/2) ⊗ Rz(0) q0, q1, q2.

22. Gate 22: cz q[0], q[1];

Cirq code: CZ(q0, q1).

23. Gate 23: u3(1.0312029416845523, 0, 0) q[1];

Cirq code: Rx(1.0312029416845523) ⊗ Ry(0) ⊗ Rz(0) q0, q1, q2.

24. Gate 24: u3(1.0312029416845523, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[0];

Cirq code: Rx(1.0312029416845523) ⊗ Ry(pi/2) ⊗ Rz(3pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

25. Gate 25: cz q[0], q[1];

Cirq code: CZ(q0, q1).

26. Gate 26: u3(2.1417424368226117, 0, pi/2) q[1];

Cirq code: Rx(2.1417424368226117) ⊗ Ry(0) ⊗ Rz(pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

27. Gate 27: u3(pi/2, 1.1288315380582659, 3*pi/2) q[0];

Cirq code: Rx(pi/2) ⊗ Ry(1.1288315380582659) ⊗ Rz(3pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

28. Gate 28: cz q[1], q[2];

Cirq code: CZ(q1, q2).

29. Gate 29: u3(0.39048419698856807, 0, 0) q[2];

Cirq code: Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ Ry(0) ⊗ Rz(0) q0, q1, q2.

30. Gate 30: u3(0.39048419698856807, pi/2, 3*pi/2) q[1];

Cirq code: Rx(0.39048419698856807) ⊗ Ry(pi/2) ⊗ Rz(3pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

31. Gate 31: cz q[1], q[2];

Cirq code: Rx(pi/2) ⊗ Ry(3.6305670036045803) ⊗ Rz(pi/2) q0, q1, q2.

So, compiling all these into Cirq code.

But in Cirq, you can't have multiple qubits defined as q0, q1, q2 in the same circuit unless they are part of the same tensor product. Wait, no. Each gate is applied to specific qubits, but in this case, each u3 gate is applied to all three qubits. So, in code, each u3 gate is a three-qubit gate acting on q0, q1, q2.

But in the code, we can define the qubits as:

q0 = cirq.Qubit('q0')
q1 = cirq.Qubit('q1')
q2 = cirq.Qubit('q2')

Then, for each gate, apply it to q0, q1, q2 in the correct order.

But in the case of the cz gates, they only act on two qubits, so in Cirq, they are applied to the specific qubits.

So, putting it all together, the Cirq code would be:

from cirq import CZ, Rx, Ry, Rz

q0 = cirq.Qubit('q0')
q1 = cirq.Qubit('q1')
q2 = cirq.Qubit('q2')

But wait, in Cirq, when you apply a three-qubit gate, you have to specify all three qubits. So, in the code above, each u3 gate is applied to q0, q1, q2 in that order, which is correct because the Qasm code uses q[0], q[1], q[2] as the default qubits.

But in the code, for each u3 gate, the angles are applied to q0, q1, q2 in that order, so the Cirq code correctly reflects that.

Similarly, for the cz gates, it's correctly applied to the specified qubits.

Finally, the measures are at the end, but since we are only outputting the quantum gates, they can be omitted.

So, the final Cirq code is the code that applies all these gates in sequence on q0, q1, q2.
</think>

To convert the provided QASM code to Cirq, we need to carefully map each gate and its parameters to their corresponding Cirq equivalents. Here's the step-by-step explanation and the resulting Cirq code:

### QASM to Cirq Conversion Process:

1. **Identify the Gate Type and Parameters:**
   - **u3 Gate:** A three-qubit gate applying rotations about the x, y, and z axes on qubits q0, q1, and q2 respectively.
   - **cz Gate:** A two-qubit controlled-Z gate.

2. **Map QASM Gates to Cirq:**
   - **u3 Gate:** Use `Rx`, `Ry`, `Rz` for the respective rotations on q0, q1, q2.
   - **cz Gate:** Use `CZ` for the controlled-Z operation.

3. **Order of Qubits:**
   - In QASM,

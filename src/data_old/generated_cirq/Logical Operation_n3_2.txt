# Generated from: Logical Operation
# Qubits: 3
 qubits

So, I need to convert each part of this QASM code to Cirq. Let's break it down.

First, the initial lines:

OPENQASM 3.0;
include "stdgates.inc";

These are standard headers, so they can remain as they are.

Next, the gate definition:

gate cH _gate_q_0, _gate_q_1 {
  h _gate_q_1;
  sdg _gate_q_1;
  cx _gate_q_0, _gate_q_1;
  h _gate_q_1;
  t _gate_q_1;
  cx _gate_q_0, _gate_q_1;
  t _gate_q_1;
  h _gate_q_1;
  s _gate_q_1;
  x _gate_q_1;
  s _gate_q_0;
}

This looks like a custom gate called cH, which takes q0 and q1. The body of the gate includes several standard gates. I think this is a custom two-qubit gate, so I'll need to represent it as a custom gate in Cirq. Let's see the operations:

h on q1: Hadamard
sdg on q1: S followed by DG (which is S followed by X followed by S?), wait, no, S DG is S followed by some other gates? Wait, actually, in QASM, "sdg" is the S followed by DG gate. S is the T gate? Or wait, maybe S is the sqrt(X+X), and DG is Diagonal gate. Or, perhaps "sdg" is a built-in gate which is a specific composite. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be "S DG", but in any case, let's see the operations step by step.

But perhaps for the purposes of conversion, it's easier to just write the operations as they are. So the cH gate applies h to q1, then sdg to q1, then cx (controlled X) from q0 to q1, then h to q1, t to q1, cx from q0 to q1, t to q1, h to q1, s to q1, x to q1, and finally s to q0.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me parse the gate operations in order:

1. h _gate_q_1: apply H to q1
2. sdg _gate_q_1: apply S followed by DG to q1
3. cx _gate_q_0, _gate_q_1: apply CX (controlled X) from q0 to q1
4. h _gate_q_1: apply H to q1 again
5. t _gate_q_1: apply T gate to q1
6. cx _gate_q_0, _gate_q_1: apply CX again
7. t _gate_q_1: apply T again
8. h _gate_q_1: apply H
9. s _gate_q_1: apply S to q1
10. x _gate_q_1: apply X to q1
11. s _gate_q_0: apply S to q0

So the custom gate cH is applying a series of operations on q0 and q1. Hmm, this seems a bit involved. I wonder if this is a standard gate or a custom one. Since it's a custom gate, in Cirq, we can represent it as a custom two-qubit gate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of standard gates that can be represented as a combination of existing Cirq gates.

But perhaps for simplicity, in Cirq, we can create a custom gate. So, in Cirq, I can create a gate that takes two qubits (q0 and q1) and applies the sequence of operations as per the cH definition.

But perhaps it's easier to represent this as a custom operation rather than trying to decompose it into standard gates. So in the Cirq code, I'll need to define this custom gate. So, first, after the include, I'll have to define the cH gate.

Wait, but the initial code in QASM includes stdgates.inc, which includes standard gates like h, s, cx, t, etc. So in Cirq, we can use the built-in gates.

So, the cH gate is a custom two-qubit gate, which applies a sequence of operations to q0 and q1. So, to represent this in Cirq, perhaps the cH gate can be written as a custom two-qubit gate that applies the operations in order.

But perhaps it's more efficient to see if the cH gate is a known gate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of several standard gates, but it's easier to just write a custom gate.

But let me think: perhaps the cH gate is a specific two-qubit gate that can be represented using CNOT and some other gates. Alternatively, perhaps the cH gate is a certain combination of H, S, T gates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just proceed step by step.

Next part of the code:

bit[3] c;
qubit[3] q;

This declares a classical bit c and a qubit register q, both of size 3.

Then:

u3(1.91063, 0, 0) q[0];
cH q[0], q[1];
ccx q[0], q[1], q[2];
x q[0];
x q[1];
cx q[0], q[1];
c[0] = measure q[0];
c[1] = measure q[1];
c[2] = measure q[2];

So, the quantum circuit is as follows:

1. Apply u3 with angles (1.91063, 0, 0) to q[0]. u3 is a three-qubit unitary, probably a rotation around some axis. I'll need to find what u3 with these angles corresponds to in Cirq.

2. Apply the cH gate to q0 and q1.

3. Apply ccx (three-qubit controlled-X) to q0, q1, q2. Wait, in QASM, ccx is a three-qubit gate where the first qubit is the control, and the other two are targets, applying X to each if the control is |1>.

But in Cirq, the cccx is the three-qubit controlled-X. Wait, no, wait: the three-qubit ccx is usually the CCNOT gate, which is a three-qubit gate where the first qubit is control, and the other two are targets.

Then, x q0 and x q1, which are single-qubit X gates.

Then, cx q0, q1, which is a two-qubit controlled-X.

Finally, measure all three qubits into classical variables c0, c1, c2.

So, the overall circuit is: prepare the first qubit with a specific unitary, apply cH to q0 and q1, apply ccx to q0, q1, q2, apply x to q0 and q1, apply cx to q0 and q1, then measure all.

Now, let's proceed to translate each part.

First, the u3 gate: in QASM, u3 is a three-qubit unitary with three parameters, usually representing a rotation around the X, Y, or Z axis, or some combination. In Cirq, the u3 gate is represented as a custom three-qubit gate, but more commonly, we use rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes with different parameters.

Wait, the default u3 in QASM is u3(theta, phi, alpha), which is a rotation matrix, but perhaps I'm getting the parameters wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a general three-qubit unitary, which can be represented in Cirq as a custom gate. But in Cirq, it's easier to use the built-in u3 gate if it's available. Let me check the Cirq documentation: yes, Cirq has a u3 gate, which can be used as cirq.U3(*amps). So I can use that.

Next, the cH gate: as discussed, it's a custom two-qubit gate that applies a series of operations. So in Cirq, I'll need to define this as a custom two-qubit gate.

Then, the ccx gate: in QASM, this is a three-qubit controlled-X gate, so in Cirq, it's represented as cirq.CCNOT.

The x gates are single-qubit, so straightforward.

The cx gate is a two-qubit controlled-X, so cirq.CX.

Now, let's start writing the Cirq code.

First, include the standard gates:

from cirq import CNOT, CX, X, CCNOT, U3, custom_gate

But I think I should import everything I need.

But perhaps it's better to structure it properly. So the code would start with:

from cirq import CNOT, CX, X, CCNOT, U3, custom_gate

Then, define the cH gate as a custom two-qubit gate.

But how to represent the sequence of operations as a custom gate?

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the cH gate as a combination of existing gates, but given the sequence, it's a bit involved.

Let me think: the cH gate applies h to q1, then sdg to q1, then cx to q0 and q1, then h to q1, t to q1, cx again, t again, h, s to q1, x to q1, and s to q0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the cH gate as a series of operations. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent it as a custom gate with q0 and q1, and apply each operation step by step.

So, in Cirq, a custom two-qubit gate can be defined using a function that takes q0 and q1, and applies the operations in order.

So, the cH gate can be defined as follows:

def cH(q0, q1):
    # q0 and q1 are the two qubits
    # Apply each operation in sequence
    # 1. h on q1
    h = X / np.sqrt(2)
    # 2. sdg on q1: S followed by DG?
    # Wait, S is sqrt(X + X), and DG is diagonal gate, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]
    # Wait, no: in QASM, "sdg" is a built-in gate which is S followed by DG? Or is it a specific composite gate?
    # Let me check. Looking up the QASM documentation, "sdg" is the S followed by DG gate. But in reality, S is the T gate (sqrt(X + X)), and DG is diagonal.

    # So, applying S followed by DG on q1.
    # Alternatively, perhaps it's a composite gate, but for the sake of time, perhaps we can just apply S and DG as separate operations.

    # Similarly, cx is a controlled-X gate.

    # So, perhaps the cH gate is a custom two-qubit gate that applies the following operations:
    # h on q1
    # sdg on q1 (but perhaps it's S followed by DG)
    # cx from q0 to q1
    # and so on.

But perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the cH gate is a specific two-qubit gate that can be represented as a combination of H, S, T, and X gates. But given the time, perhaps it's better to proceed with defining the cH gate as a custom gate that applies the operations in order.

So, in Cirq, to define a custom two-qubit gate, I can create a function that takes q0 and q1, and applies each operation in sequence.

So, let's define the cH gate:

def custom_cH(q0, q1):
    # Apply h to q1
    h = X / np.sqrt(2)
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply sdg to q1: S followed by DG
    # S is sqrt(X + X), and DG is diagonal
    s = S()
    dg = DiagonalGate()
    # But wait, in QASM, "sdg" is a single gate, which may be a composite of S and DG
    # Or perhaps it's better to apply S then DG
    s.on(q1)
    dg.on(q1)
    # Then cx from q0 to q1
    cx = CX()
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    # Then h on q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Then t on q1
    t = T()
    t.on(q1)
    # Then cx again
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    t.on(q1)
    # Then h on q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Then s on q1
    s.on(q1)
    # Then x on q1
    x = X()
    x.on(q1)
    # Then s on q0
    s.on(q0)
    return

Wait, but in QASM, the order is important. The cH gate applies these operations in sequence. So, in the function, I need to apply them in the same order as in the QASM code.

So, let's list the operations again:

1. h q1
2. sdg q1
3. cx q0 q1
4. h q1
5. t q1
6. cx q0 q1
7. t q1
8. h q1
9. s q1
10. x q1
11. s q0

So, the function should apply these in order.

But wait, in QASM, the gates are applied in the order they are written inside the gate. So, the function should execute them in that order.

So, in the function, the order is important.

So, let me rewrite the function accordingly.

def custom_cH(q0, q1):
    # q0 and q1 are the two qubits
    # Apply h to q1
    h = X() / np.sqrt(2)
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply sdg to q1: which is S followed by DG
    # So, first S, then DG
    s = S()
    s.on(q1)
    dg = DiagonalGate()
    dg.on(q1)
    # Then cx from q0 to q1
    cx = CX()
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    # Then h to q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Then t to q1
    t = T()
    t.on(q1)
    # Then cx again
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    t.on(q1)
    # Then h again
    h.on(q1)
    # Then s to q1
    s.on(q1)
    # Then x to q1
    x = X()
    x.on(q1)
    # Then s to q0
    s.on(q0)
    return

Wait, but in the QASM code, the "sdg" is a single gate, not S followed by DG as separate operations. So perhaps in QASM, "sdg" is a specific composite gate. So perhaps I need to find what "sdg" does.

Looking up the QASM documentation, "sdg" is the S followed by DG gate, which is a two-qubit gate. S is the T gate (sqrt(X + X)), and DG is the diagonal gate. So, applying "sdg" would first apply S, then DG.

Wait, no, DG is the diagonal gate which is the identity matrix. So, applying S followed by DG would be equivalent to applying S, then identity. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps "sdg" is a specific two-qubit gate that's a combination of S and DG, but I think it's better to represent it as S followed by DG.

So, in the code, I'll have to apply S to q1, then DG to q1.

But wait, in the function, the order is important. So, first S, then DG on q1.

So, in the function, after h on q1, apply S on q1, then DG on q1.

So, I think the function is correctly written.

But perhaps it's better to use the built-in gates for S and DG. Wait, in Cirq, there's a built-in S gate, which is cirq.S, and DG is a diagonal gate. But in Cirq, the DiagonalGate is a built-in gate as well.

So, perhaps I can use:

from cirq import S, DiagonalGate, X, CX

Then, in the custom_cH function, apply S and then DiagonalGate on q1.

But I'm not sure if "sdg" in QASM is a composite gate or a built-in. Looking up, it seems that "sdg" is a built-in gate in OpenQasm, which may correspond to a specific composite.

But for the purposes of this conversion, perhaps it's better to represent "sdg" as S followed by DG.

Alternatively, perhaps "sdg" is equivalent to a certain combination of gates. But without more information, I think it's safer to represent it as S followed by DG.

So, proceeding with that.

Now, after defining the custom_cH gate, the code proceeds to create the qubits:

qubit[3] q;

But in Cirq, this would be represented as q = [q0, q1, q2], each being qubit objects.

Then, u3(1.91063, 0, 0) q[0];

In Cirq, this is a three-qubit unitary. The u3 gate in Cirq is represented as cirq.U3, which takes the three angles as parameters. So, in the code:

u3 = U3(1.91063, 0, 0)

u3.on(q[0])

Wait, but in Cirq, the U3 gate is a three-qubit gate, so applying it to a single qubit may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to apply the u3 gate to a specific qubit.

Wait, in the QASM code, u3 is applied to q[0], which is the first qubit. So, in Cirq, we can create a U3 gate and apply it to q0.

So:

u3 = U3(1.91063, 0, 0)
u3.on(q[0])

Next, apply the cH gate to q0 and q1:

cH q[0], q[1]

Which, in Cirq, would be:

custom_cH(q[0], q[1])

Then, apply ccx to q0, q1, q2:

ccx q[0], q[1], q[2]

In Cirq, this is a three-qubit controlled-X gate, so:

ccx = CCNOT()
ccx.on(q[0], q[1], q[2])

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the CNOT gate if the control is only one qubit. But in this case, it's a three-qubit gate where the first is control and the other two are targets.

Wait, no, in the QASM code, it's ccx, which is a three-qubit gate where the first is control, and the other two are targets, each being flipped if the control is |1>.

So, in Cirq, the correct gate is CCNOT, which is a three-qubit gate.

So, I'll define:

ccx = CCNOT()
ccx.on(q[0], q[1], q[2])

Then, x q[0]:

x = X()
x.on(q[0])

x q[1]:

x.on(q[1])

Then, cx q0, q1:

cx = CX()
cx.on(q[0], q[1])

Finally, measure all qubits:

c = [c0, c1, c2] = measure(q[0], q[1], q[2])

Wait, but in Cirq, the measurement is done using the measurement operator. So, after all the gates are applied, we need to measure each qubit.

So, the code would be:

c0 = measurement(q[0])
c1 = measurement(q[1])
c2 = measurement(q[2])

But in Cirq, the measurement is an operator, so perhaps:

from cirq import measurement as measure

c0 = measure(q[0])
c1 = measure(q[1])
c2 = measure(q[2])

Putting it all together, the Cirq code would be:

from cirq import CNOT, CX, X, CCNOT, U3, custom_cH, measurement

# Define custom_cH gate
def custom_cH(q0, q1):
    # Apply h to q1
    h = X() / np.sqrt(2)
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply sdg to q1: S followed by DG
    s = S()
    s.on(q1)
    dg = DiagonalGate()
    dg.on(q1)
    # Apply cx from q0 to q1
    cx = CX()
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    # Apply h to q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply t to q1
    t = T()
    t.on(q1)
    # Apply cx again
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    t.on(q1)
    # Apply h to q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply s to q1
    s.on(q1)
    # Apply x to q1
    x = X()
    x.on(q1)
    # Apply s to q0
    s.on(q0)

# Initialize qubits
q = [q0, q1, q2]

# Apply u3 to q0
u3 = U3(1.91063, 0, 0)
u3.on(q[0])

# Apply custom_cH to q0 and q1
custom_cH(q[0], q[1])

# Apply ccx to q0, q1, q2
ccx = CCNOT()
ccx.on(q[0], q[1], q[2])

# Apply x to q0 and q1
x.on(q[0])
x.on(q[1])

# Apply cx to q0 and q1
cx = CX()
cx.on(q[0], q[1])

# Measure all qubits
c0 = measure(q[0])
c1 = measure(q[1])
c2 = measure(q[2])

Wait, but in Cirq, you can't have q = [q0, q1, q2] like that. The qubits are individual objects. So, perhaps I should define each qubit separately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to create a list of qubits, each as qubit objects.

So, perhaps:

q = [q0, q1, q2]

But in the code, how are q0, q1, q2 created? In the QASM code, they are qubit[3] q, which in Cirq would be q = qubit.Qubit() * 3, or more accurately, a list of qubits.

But perhaps the correct way is to create a list of qubits, each being a qubit object.

So, in Cirq:

q0 = qubit.Qubit()
q1 = qubit.Qubit()
q2 = qubit.Qubit()
q = [q0, q1, q2]

Then, apply the gates accordingly.

But perhaps it's better to use q = qubit.Qubit().to_list() or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the qubits as a list.

So, perhaps the code would start with:

from cirq import CNOT, CX, X, CCNOT, U3, custom_cH, measurement, Qubit

q0 = Qubit()
q1 = Qubit()
q2 = Qubit()
q = [q0, q1, q2]

Then proceed as before.

So, putting it all together:

from cirq import CNOT, CX, X, CCNOT, U3, custom_cH, measurement, Qubit

# Define custom_cH gate
def custom_cH(q0, q1):
    # Apply h to q1
    h = X() / np.sqrt(2)
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply sdg to q1: S followed by DG
    s = S()
    s.on(q1)
    dg = DiagonalGate()
    dg.on(q1)
    # Apply cx from q0 to q1
    cx = CX()
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    # Apply h to q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply t to q1
    t = T()
    t.on(q1)
    # Apply cx again
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    t.on(q1)
    # Apply h to q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply s to q1
    s.on(q1)
    # Apply x to q1
    x = X()
    x.on(q1)
    # Apply s to q0
    s.on(q0)

# Initialize qubits
q0 = Qubit()
q1 = Qubit()
q2 = Qubit()
q = [q0, q1, q2]

# Apply u3 to q0
u3 = U3(1.91063, 0, 0)
u3.on(q[0])

# Apply custom_cH to q0 and q1
custom_cH(q[0], q[1])

# Apply ccx to q0, q1, q2
ccx = CCNOT()
ccx.on(q[0], q[1], q[2])

# Apply x to q0 and q1
x = X()
x.on(q[0])
x.on(q[1])

# Apply cx to q0 and q1
cx = CX()
cx.on(q[0], q[1])

# Measure all qubits
c0 = measurement(q[0])
c1 = measurement(q[1])
c2 = measurement(q[2])

Wait, but in Cirq, you can't directly measure qubits like that. The measurement is an operator that is applied to a qubit, returning a classical value.

So, the correct way is:

c0 = measurement(q0)
c1 = measurement(q1)
c2 = measurement(q2)

But in the code, after all the gates are applied, you can just measure each qubit.

So, the final code would be:

from cirq import CNOT, CX, X, CCNOT, U3, custom_cH, measurement, Qubit

def custom_cH(q0, q1):
    # Apply h to q1
    h = X() / np.sqrt(2)
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply sdg to q1: S followed by DG
    s = S()
    s.on(q1)
    dg = DiagonalGate()
    dg.on(q1)
    # Apply cx from q0 to q1
    cx = CX()
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    # Apply h to q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply t to q1
    t = T()
    t.on(q1)
    # Apply cx again
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    t.on(q1)
    # Apply h to q1 again
    h.on(q1)
    # Apply s to q1
    s.on(q1)
    # Apply x to q1
    x = X()
    x.on(q1)
    # Apply s to q0
    s.on(q0)

q0 = Qubit()
q1 = Qubit()
q2 = Qubit()
q = [q0, q1, q2]

u3 = U3(1.91063, 0, 0)
u3.on(q[0])

custom_cH(q[0], q[1])

ccx = CCNOT()
ccx.on(q[0], q[1], q[2])

x = X()
x.on(q[0])
x.on(q[1])

cx = CX()
cx.on(q[0], q[1])

c0 = measurement(q[0])
c1 = measurement(q[1])
c2 = measurement(q[2])

But wait, in Cirq, the gates are applied in the order they are written, but the qubits are stored as a list. So, the code should work.

But I need to make sure that the custom_cH function is correctly defined. Also, the S, X, CX, etc., are imported from cirq.

So, putting it all together, the final Cirq code would be as written above.

But I think I should verify each part.

Wait, the initial cH gate in QASM is a two-qubit gate, so in Cirq, it's a custom two-qubit gate. So, the function custom_cH should take two qubits and apply the sequence of operations as per the QASM code.

I think this should work.
</think>

To convert the provided QASM code to Cirq, we follow these steps:

1. **Include Necessary Imports**: We import the required Cirq gates and measurement functions.

2. **Define Custom Gates**: The `cH` gate from QASM is a custom two-qubit gate, so we define it as a function applying the sequence of operations.

3. **Initialize Qubits**: We create qubit objects for each qubit in the circuit.

4. **Apply Gates**: We apply each quantum gate in the order specified by the QASM code.

5. **Measure Qubits**: Finally, we measure each qubit to get the classical results.

Here's the Cirq code:

```python
from cirq import CNOT, CX, X, CCNOT, U3, custom_cH, measurement, Qubit

def custom_cH(q0, q1):
    h = X() / (2 ** 0.5)
    h.on(q1)
    s = S()
    s.on(q1)
    dg = DiagonalGate()
    dg.on(q1)
    cx = CX()
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    h.on(q1)
    t = T()
    t.on(q1)
    cx.on(q0, q1)
    t.on(q1)
    h.on(q1)
    s.on(q1)
    x = X()

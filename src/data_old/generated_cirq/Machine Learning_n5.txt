Circuit Structure:

- Start with H on q0, q1, q3, q4 (q2 is initial state |0>
- Apply C X gates between q3 and q2, q0 and q2
- Then H on q0, q1, q2, q3, q4
- Meas each qubit

I need to structure this into a Cirq Circuit.
So the steps are:

1. Create a Circuit object.
2. Add the qubits: q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.
3. Add H gate on q0, q1, q3, q4.
4. Add C X (controlled-x) gates: q3 to q2, q0 to q2.
5. Then add H gates on q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.
6. Finally, measure each qubit.

Wait, but in the QASM code, the H gate on q0 is applied twice. So perhaps I need to make sure that's handled correctly.

In Cirq, the order matters. So I need to make sure the gates are applied in the right order.

Wait, looking back at the QASM code:

The first set of H's:

h q[0];
h q[1];
h q[3];
h q[4];

Then cx q[3], q[2];
cx q[0], q[2];

Then another set of H's:

h q[0];
h q[1];
h q[2];
h q[3];
h q[4];

So the initial state is |0> on q2, and all other qubits are initialized as |0> as well?

Wait, but in the QASM code, the qubits are initialized as qubit[5] q; which would be q0 to q4.

But in the code, q[0] is the first qubit, I think. So q0 is qubit 0, q1 qubit 1, etc.

So the initial state is |0> for all qubits, except q2 is |0> as per OPENQASM 3.0.

So, in Cirq, we need to create a Circuit, add qubits 0 to 4, and apply the H gates in the correct order.

Wait, the QASM code does H on q0, q1, q3, q4.

Then applies C X (controlled-x) from q3 to q2, and from q0 to q2.

So for the C X gates: q3 controls q2, q0 controls q2.

So that would be: CX(q3, q2), CX(q0, q2).

Then after that, H on q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.

Then measure each qubit.

So in Cirq, the steps would be:

circuit = Circuit(qubits)

circuit.H(0)
circuit.H(1)
circuit.H(3)
circuit.H(4)

circuit.CX(3,2)
circuit.CX(0,2)

Then H on 0,1,2,3,4.

Then measure each qubit.

So in code, that would be:

circuit = Circuit([q0, q1, q2, q3, q4])

circuit.h(q[0])
circuit.h(q[1])
circuit.h(q[3])
circuit.h(q[4])

circuit.cx(q[3], q[2])
circuit.cx(q[0], q[2])

circuit.h(q[0])
circuit.h(q[1])
circuit.h(q[2])
circuit.h(q[3])
circuit.h(q[4])

Then:

measurement = circuit.measure(q0)
measurement = circuit.measure(q1)
measurement = circuit.measure(q2)
measurement = circuit.measure(q3)
measurement = circuit.measure(q4)

But wait, in Cirq, the order of the qubits matters. Are the qubits ordered as q0, q1, q2, q3, q4 in the Circuit?

Yes, because we create them in that order.

So in the code, the Circuit is created as Circuit([q0, q1, q2, q3, q4]).

Wait, but in Cirq, the first qubit is the leftmost, so the ordering is correct.

So the code would look like:

from cirq import Circuit, H, CX, Measure

circuit = Circuit([q0, q1, q2, q3, q4])

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)
circuit.cx(q3, q2)
circuit.cx(q0, q2)
circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q2)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)

for q in circuit.qubits():
    circuit.measure(q)

Wait, but in the QASM code, it's:

c[0] = measure q[0];
c[1] = measure q[1];
c[2] = measure q[2];
c[3] = measure q[3];
c[4] = measure q[4];

Which in Cirq would correspond to measuring each qubit in order.

But in the code above, the for loop just measures each qubit in the order of the circuit's qubits, which is q0, q1, q2, q3, q4. So that's correct.

But in the initial steps, the H gates on q0, q1, q3, q4, then CX gates, then H on all.

Wait, but in the QASM code, after the initial H gates and CX gates, we have another set of H gates on all qubits. So in Cirq, that's correct.

But wait, in the initial H gates, q2 is not touched. Then after CX gates, q2 is controlled. Then after that, q2 is put back into H.

But in the initial state, q2 is |0>, then H would turn it into |+>.

So that's correct.

But in the QASM code, the initial H on q0, q1, q3, q4, then CX, then H on all, which includes q2. So yes, q2 is H'ed after the CX.

So the Cirq code should reflect that.

But wait, in the initial steps, the H gates on q0, q1, q3, q4 are followed by the CX gates, then another set of H gates on q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.

So in Cirq, the order is correct.

Therefore, the code should be:

from cirq import Circuit, H, CX, Measure

circuit = Circuit([q0, q1, q2, q3, q4])

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)
circuit.cx(q3, q2)
circuit.cx(q0, q2)
circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q2)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)

# Measure each qubit
for q in circuit.qubits():
    circuit.measure(q)

Wait, but in the QASM code, after the CX gates, the H gates are applied again, which would reset q0, q1, q3, q4 to |+>, but q2 is also H'ed, turning from |+> to |0>.

Wait, let me think about the process:

Initial state: All qubits are |0>.

After first H on q0: |0> → |+>
After H on q1: |0> → |+>
q3: |0> → |+>
q4: |0> → |+>
So after first H gates, q0, q1, q3, q4 are |+>, q2 is |0>.

Then CX q3, q2: So q3 is |+>, q2 is |0>. The CX gate will flip q2 if q3 is |1>. Since q3 is |+>, which is sqrt(1/2)(|0> + |1>), then when you apply CX(q3, q2), the state of q2 depends on q3. So q2 becomes |0> + |1> / sqrt(2), but since q3 is |+>, it's entangled.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the state becomes:

After the first H gates:

q0: |+>
q1: |+>
q2: |0>
q3: |+>
q4: |+>

Then apply CX(q3, q2): So the controlled q3 is q3, target q2.

So the state after CX(q3, q2):

q3: |+>
q2: |+>
But wait, no. Because the CX gate flips the target qubit if the control is |1>.

So the initial q2 is |0>, and q3 is |+>. So the result after CX(q3, q2) is:

q3 remains |+>
q2 becomes |0> + |1>, because q3 is |+> (which is |0> + |1>), so for each component, q2 is flipped.

Wait, that's correct.

So after CX(q3, q2), the state is:

q0: |+>
q1: |+>
q2: |+>
q3: |+>
q4: |+>

Wait, no, because CX only flips the target if the control is |1>. So:

When q3 is |0>, q2 remains as it was. When q3 is |1>, q2 flips.

In the initial state, q3 is |+> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2). So when you apply CX(q3, q2), the state becomes:

q3: |+>
q2: |0> + |1> (since for |0> part of q3, q2 remains |0>, and for |1> part, q2 flips to |1>).

So the combined state is:

|+> for q3, |+> for q2.

Wait, no:

Wait, if q3 is |+>, then applying CX(q3, q2) gives:

q3: |+>
q2: |0> + |1> because for each state of q3, the control is |0>, so q2 remains, and |1> for q3, so q2 is flipped.

Wait, no. The CX gate is: if control is |1>, then target is flipped.

So the operation can be written as:

|0> |a> → |0> |a>
|1> |a> → |1> |a^1>

So when q3 is |+>, the state is (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2) for q3, and |0> for q2.

So when you apply CX(q3, q2), the result is:

For |0> component of q3: |0> for q3, so q2 remains |0>.

For |1> component of q3: |1> for q3, so q2 becomes |0^1> = |1>.

So the combined state is:

(|0> |0> + |1> |1>) / sqrt(2).

So q2 is entangled with q3 as |+>|+>.

Wait, but that's not correct, because |+> for q2 would be (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2). But here, it's |0> and |1> for q2, but both entangled with q3 in |+> states.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of states.

After the CX(q3, q2), the combined state of q2 and q3 is |+>|+>.

Because:

CX acting on |0> |0> gives |0> |0>

CX acting on |0> |1> gives |0> |1>

CX acting on |1> |0> gives |1> |1>

CX acting on |1> |1> gives |1> |0>

Wait, no. CX only flips the target if the control is |1>.

So, the matrix for CX is:

[ [1 0 0 0],
  [0 1 0 0],
  [0 0 0 1],
  [0 0 1 0] ]

So for q3 control, q2 target, the operation is:

|a> |b> → |a> |b⊕(a ∧ 1)>

So for a=0, b remains.

For a=1, b is flipped.

So initial state is q3: |+> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), q2: |0>.

After CX(q3, q2):

The combined state becomes:

(q3=|0>) (q2=|0>) → remains |0> |0>

(q3=|0>) (q2=|1>) → |0> |1>

(q3=|1>) (q2=|0>) → |1> |1>

(q3=|1>) (q2=|1>) → |1> |0>

So combining these, the total state is:

|0> (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2) + |1> (|1> + |0>) / sqrt(2)

= (|0> |0> + |0> |1> + |1> |1> + |1> |0>)/sqrt(2)

= (|0> |0> + |0> |1> + |1> |1> + |1> |0>)/sqrt(2)

= (|0> |+> + |1> |1> + |1> |0>)/sqrt(2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

( |00> + |01> + |11> + |10> ) / sqrt(2)

Which can be grouped as:

|+> |+> / sqrt(2) ?

Because |+> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2).

Wait:

|+> |+> = (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2) * (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2) = (|00> + |01> + |10> + |11>)/2.

But our state after CX is (|00> + |01> + |11> + |10>)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * (|+> |+> ).

Wait, no:

sqrt(2) * (|+> |+> ) = (|00> + |01> + |10> + |11>)/sqrt(2).

Yes, exactly the state we have.

So after CX(q3, q2), the combined state of q2 and q3 is |+>|+>.

Then we apply CX(q0, q2).

So q0 is |+>, q2 is |+>.

So the combined state after CX(q0, q2):

q0: |+>

q2: |+> flipped if q0 is |1>.

So the combined state is:

For q0=|0>, q2 remains |+>.

For q0=|1>, q2 becomes |0>.

So the total state is:

|+> ( |+> + |0> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no, more accurately, it's |+> |+> for q0=|0>, and |+> |0> for q0=|1>.

So overall:

( |+> |+> + |+> |0> ) / sqrt(2).

Which can be written as |+> ( |+> + |0> ) / sqrt(2).

Which simplifies to |+> |+> / sqrt(2) + |+> |0> / sqrt(2).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about how the CX gate affects the combined state.

Alternatively, after CX(q0, q2), the state becomes:

(q0=|+>) (q2=|+> + |0> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, perhaps that's correct.

Then, after that, we apply H on q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.

So let's see:

After the CX(q0, q2), the state is:

q0: |+>
q1: |+>
q2: |+>
q3: |+>
q4: |+>

Wait, no, because after CX(q0, q2), q2 is entangled with q0.

Wait, no, after CX(q0, q2), the state is:

(q0 and q2) as |+>|+> + |+>|0> ?

No, earlier we saw that after CX(q0, q2), the combined state is |+> |+> for q0=0, and |+> |0> for q0=1, but perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that after all the gates, the final state is |+> for all qubits, and then we measure each qubit.

But perhaps the exact final state is not necessary for the code, as the code just needs to apply the gates in the correct order.

So, in the Cirq code, the steps are:

- Create a circuit with qubits q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.

- Apply H to q0, q1, q3, q4.

- Apply CX(q3, q2), then CX(q0, q2).

- Apply H to all qubits.

- Measure each qubit.

So the code should implement that.

But in the initial H gates, q2 is not H'ed. Then after CX, q2 is H'ed again.

So in the code, it's correct.

But wait, the initial H's are:

h q[0];
h q[1];
h q[3];
h q[4];

Then CX's, then H on all.

So in the code, after the initial H's on 0,1,3,4, then CX's, then H on 0,1,2,3,4.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code would be:

from cirq import Circuit, H, CX, Measure

circuit = Circuit([q0, q1, q2, q3, q4])

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)

circuit.cx(q3, q2)
circuit.cx(q0, q2)

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q2)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)

for q in circuit.qubits():
    circuit.measure(q)

But wait, in the QASM code, after the initial H's and CX's, the H's are applied again.

So that's correct.

But perhaps in the Cirq code, the order of qubits in the CX gates is important. For example, CX(q3, q2) is equivalent to applying CX with control q3 and target q2.

In Cirq, the CX function takes control and target as arguments in that order, so circuit.cx(q3, q2) is correct.

Yes.

So the code should compile and work as intended.
</think>

To convert the provided QASM code into Cirq code, we need to accurately replicate the quantum circuit described. Here's the breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialize the Circuit**: Create a Cirq Circuit object with the appropriate qubits in the correct order.

2. **Apply Hadamard Gates**: Apply the Hadamard gate to qubits 0, 1, 3, and 4.

3. **Apply Controlled-X Gates**: Apply the Controlled-X (CNOT) gate with qubit 3 controlling qubit 2, and qubit 0 controlling qubit 2.

4. **Apply Additional Hadamard Gates**: Apply the Hadamard gate to all qubits, including qubit 2.

5. **Measure Each Qubit**: Perform measurements on each qubit to obtain the classical outcomes.

Here is the resulting Cirq code:

```python
from cirq import Circuit, H, CX, Measure

# Create a Circuit with qubits q0 to q4
circuit = Circuit([q0, q1, q2, q3, q4])

# Apply H gates on q0, q1, q3, q4
circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)

# Apply CX gates: CX(q3, q2) and CX(q0, q2)
circuit.cx(q3, q2)
circuit.cx(q0, q2)

# Apply H gates on all qubits
circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.h(q2)
circuit.h(q3)
circuit.h(q4)

# Measure each qubit
for q in circuit.qubits():
    circuit.measure(q)
```

This code correctly implements the described quantum circuit, ensuring that each gate is applied in the correct order and that all qubits are measured at the end.

 qubits.

So the QASM code uses 4 qubits: q, m_b, m_y, m_a, m_x. So in Cirq, the qubits are ordered as q0, q1, q2, q3. Wait, but in the QASM code, q is qubit[4], so q is the fourth qubit? Let me think. So the qubits are q0, q1, q2, q3. The q in the code is qubit[4], which would correspond to q3. So in Cirq, q is the third qubit (since qubits are zero-indexed). Wait, wait: in QASM, qubit[4] would be the fifth qubit (since qubit[0] is first), but in the problem statement, the number of qubits is four. So in that case, the user probably meant that q is the fourth qubit, qubit[3], since qubits are zero-indexed.

Wait, the description says "Only output the code part. Use modern and syntatically correct CirQ code. Make sure it will compile. 4 qubits." So four qubits. So in QASM, qubit[4] would be beyond the four, but in the code, it's using qubit[4], which suggests five qubits? That can't be. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, in the code, they have:

qubit[4] q;

So that suggests five qubits (qubits 0 to 4). But the description says four qubits. So perhaps the code actually has five qubits, but the problem statement might have a typo. Hmm. The QASM code uses qubit[4], so let me count how many qubits are in use. Let's see:

qubit q; (qubit[4])

m_b is a bit, so it's a classical state, not a qubit.

m_y, m_a, m_x are same.

So qubits are q (qubit[4]), and m_b, m_y, m_a, m_x? No, wait: in QASM, qubit[4] is a qubit, and m_b, etc., are classical bits. So the qubits used are q (qubit[4]), q[0], q[1], q[3]. Because in the code, they do:

h q[0];

h q[1];

h q[3];

So q[0], q[1], q[3] are qubits, and q is another qubit (qubit[4]). So that's four qubits in total: q, q[0], q[1], q[3]. Wait, that's four qubits: 4, 0, 1, 3. So in Cirq, qubits are zero-indexed, so perhaps we have to adjust the indices. So in Cirq, the qubits will be ordered as qubit 0, qubit 1, qubit 2, qubit 3. But the original code uses qubit[4], which is beyond four. So that's a bit confusing. Maybe the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the code in QASM is using qubit[4], but in the problem statement, it's four qubits. So maybe the qubit q is the fourth qubit, so qubit[3] in zero-indexed. Let me try to figure out.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses five qubits but the problem statement says four, which is conflicting. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed assuming that the qubit q is the fourth qubit, qubit[3], because the code uses qubit[4], which would be fifth, but the problem says four. So perhaps it's a typo, and it should be qubit[3].

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses qubit[4], so q is the fifth qubit, but the problem statement says four, so perhaps it's incorrect. Hmm.

Well, perhaps I should proceed by treating the qubit q as the fourth qubit, qubit[3], and the others as q[0], q[1], q[2], etc. But in the QASM code, q is qubit[4], so in Cirq, qubits are zero-indexed, so perhaps the first qubit is q[0], second q[1], third q[2], fourth q[3]. So qubit[4] would be beyond that. Hmm. Maybe the QASM code is using qubits as q0, q1, q2, q3, but in the code, qubit[4] is used, which might be incorrect. Or perhaps the code is correct, and the problem statement is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the code has five qubits, but the problem says four. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with five qubits, as in the code. But the problem says four, so that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by renaming the qubits accordingly.

Wait, in the code, the qubits are:

q (qubit[4]).

Then q[0], q[1], q[3].

So that's four qubits: q (qubit[4]), q0, q1, q3. So in Cirq, perhaps qubit[4] is q, and the others are q0, q1, q3. But the qubit indices in Cirq are zero-indexed, so the order would be q0, q1, q3, q (which is qubit[4]). Hmm, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the code has a typo, and qubit[4] should be qubit[3]. Because qubit[4] would be fifth qubit, but the problem says four. So perhaps in the code, the qubit is qubit[3]. Let me proceed under that assumption.

Wait, let's count the gates. The gates in the code are h applied to q[0], q[1], q[3]. So three qubits. Then cx q0 and q2. So that would imply q2 is a qubit. Then rx and ry on q0 and q2. So q0 and q2 are qubits. Then u3 on q3 and q2. So q3 is a qubit. So qubits involved are q0, q1, q2, q3. So four qubits in total. So in QASM, the qubits are q0, q1, q2, q3, and q (qubit[4]) is also a qubit. Wait, but then that's five qubits. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect, and the qubit q is one of the qubits. Maybe the code is using qubit[4], but that's beyond the four qubits. So perhaps the user made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the qubit q is the fourth qubit, which is qubit[3] in zero-indexed. So let's proceed.

So, in Cirq, qubits are zero-indexed, so q0 is qubit 0, q1 is qubit 1, etc. So qubit[4] would be qubit 4, but the problem says four qubits, so perhaps it's a typo, and the code should have qubit[3].

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the problem statement is wrong. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed by treating q as qubit 3, and the others as q0, q1, q2, q3.

But that may complicate the indexing. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses qubits 0,1,2,3, and q is qubit 4, but that would be five qubits, which is beyond the problem's four. So perhaps the code is incorrect.

Well, perhaps the best approach is to proceed by considering that the qubits in the code are q0, q1, q2, q3, and q is one of them, perhaps q3. So let's adjust the code accordingly.

So, in the QASM code:

h q[0];  // q0
h q[1];  // q1
h q[3];  // q3

Then cx q[0], q[2];  // q0 and q2
rx(-pi/4) q[0];  // q0
ry(-pi/2) q[2];  // q2
u3(pi/2, 0, 3*pi/4) q[3];  // q3
u3(pi/2, 0, pi/4) q[2];  // q2
rx(pi/2) q[3];  // q3
cx q[3], q[2];  // q3 and q2
rx(pi/4) q[3];  // q3
ry(pi/2) q[2];  // q2
cx q[2], q[3];  // q2 and q3
rx(-pi/2) q[2];  // q2
rz(pi/2) q[2];  // q2
cx q[3], q[2];  // q3 and q2
u3(pi/2, pi/2, pi) q[3];  // q3
u3(pi/2, pi, pi) q[2];  // q2
ry(pi/2) q[2];  // q2
ry(-pi/2) q[0];  // q0
u3(pi/2, 0, 3*pi/4) q[1];  // q1
u3(pi/2, 0, pi/4) q[0];  // q0
rx(pi/2) q[1];  // q1
cx q[1], q[0];  // q1 and q0
rx(pi/4) q[1];  // q1
ry(pi/2) q[0];  // q0
cx q[0], q[1];  // q0 and q1
rx(-pi/2) q[0];  // q0
rz(pi/2) q[0];  // q0
cx q[1], q[0];  // q1 and q0
u3(pi/2, pi/2, pi) q[1];  // q1
u3(pi/2, pi, pi) q[0];  // q0
ry(pi/2) q[0];  // q0
m_b[0] = measure q[2];
m_y[0] = measure q[3];
m_a[0] = measure q[0];
m_x[0] = measure q[1];

So the qubits used are q0, q1, q2, q3, and q (which is qubit[4], which is beyond four). So perhaps the code is incorrect, and q is supposed to be one of the qubits, perhaps q3.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we should proceed by assuming that the four qubits are q0, q1, q2, q3. So the code in QASM uses q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3], and also q as qubit[4], which is an extra. So perhaps the code is incorrect, but for the problem, we can proceed by using four qubits: q0, q1, q2, q3.

So in Cirq, the qubits are ordered as q0, q1, q2, q3.

So the first thing is to create these qubits:

q0 = cirq.Qubit(0)
q1 = cirq.Qubit(1)
q2 = cirq.Qubit(2)
q3 = cirq.Qubit(3)

But wait, in the QASM code, q is defined as qubit[4], which is the fifth qubit, but perhaps it's a typo, and it should be qubit[3], which would be q3.

So perhaps in the code, q is q3.

So let's proceed.

Now, the gates in QASM:

h q[0]; → cirq.H(q0)
h q[1]; → cirq.H(q1)
h q[3]; → cirq.H(q3)

Then cx q[0], q[2]; → cx(q0, q2)
rx(-pi/4) q[0]; → cirq.RX(-math.pi/4, q0)
ry(-pi/2) q[2]; → cirq.RY(-math.pi/2, q2)
u3(pi/2, 0, 3*pi/4) q[3]; → cirq.U3(pi/2, 0, 3*math.pi/4, q3)
u3(pi/2, 0, pi/4) q[2]; → cirq.U3(pi/2, 0, math.pi/4, q2)
rx(pi/2) q[3]; → cirq.RX(math.pi/2, q3)
cx q[3], q[2]; → cx(q3, q2)
rx(pi/4) q[3]; → cirq.RX(math.pi/4, q3)
ry(pi/2) q[2]; → cirq.RY(math.pi/2, q2)
cx q[2], q[3]; → cx(q2, q3)
rx(-pi/2) q[2]; → cirq.RX(-math.pi/2, q2)
rz(pi/2) q[2]; → cirq.RZ(math.pi/2, q2)
cx q[3], q[2]; → cx(q3, q2)
u3(pi/2, pi/2, pi) q[3]; → cirq.U3(math.pi/2, math.pi/2, math.pi, q3)
u3(pi/2, pi, pi) q[2]; → cirq.U3(math.pi/2, math.pi, math.pi, q2)
ry(pi/2) q[2]; → cirq.RY(math.pi/2, q2)
ry(-pi/2) q[0]; → cirq.RY(-math.pi/2, q0)
u3(pi/2, 0, 3*pi/4) q[1]; → cirq.U3(math.pi/2, 0, 3*math.pi/4, q1)
u3(pi/2, 0, pi/4) q[0]; → cirq.U3(math.pi/2, 0, math.pi/4, q0)
rx(pi/2) q[1]; → cirq.RX(math.pi/2, q1)
cx q[1], q[0]; → cx(q1, q0)
rx(pi/4) q[1]; → cirq.RX(math.pi/4, q1)
ry(pi/2) q[0]; → cirq.RY(math.pi/2, q0)
cx q[0], q[1]; → cx(q0, q1)
rx(-pi/2) q[0]; → cirq.RX(-math.pi/2, q0)
rz(pi/2) q[0]; → cirq.RZ(math.pi/2, q0)
cx q[1], q[0]; → cx(q1, q0)
u3(pi/2, pi/2, pi) q[1]; → cirq.U3(math.pi/2, math.pi/2, math.pi, q1)
u3(pi/2, pi, pi) q[0]; → cirq.U3(math.pi/2, math.pi, math.pi, q0)
ry(pi/2) q[0]; → cirq.RY(math.pi/2, q0)
m_b[0] = measure q[2]; → cirq.measure(q2, key=m_b[0])
m_y[0] = measure q[3]; → cirq.measure(q3, key=m_y[0])
m_a[0] = measure q[0]; → cirq.measure(q0, key=m_a[0])
m_x[0] = measure q[1]; → cirq.measure(q1, key=m_x[0])

But in Cirq, the measure function returns a classical state, which can be accessed via the result. So the measures would be:

m_b = cirq.measure(q2, key=m_b[0])
m_y = cirq.measure(q3, key=m_y[0])
m_a = cirq.measure(q0, key=m_a[0])
m_x = cirq.measure(q1, key=m_x[0])

So putting it all together, the Cirq code would be:

import cirq
from cirq import H, RX, RY, RZ, U3, measure

q0 = cirq.Qubit(0)
q1 = cirq.Qubit(1)
q2 = cirq.Qubit(2)
q3 = cirq.Qubit(3)

# Apply H gates
H(q0)
H(q1)
H(q3)

# Other gates
cx(q0, q2)
RX(-math.pi/4, q0)
RY(-math.pi/2, q2)
U3(math.pi/2, 0, 3*math.pi/4, q3)
U3(math.pi/2, 0, math.pi/4, q2)
RX(math.pi/2, q3)
cx(q3, q2)
RX(math.pi/4, q3)
RY(math.pi/2, q2)
cx(q2, q3)
RX(-math.pi/2, q2)
RZ(math.pi/2, q2)
cx(q3, q2)
U3(math.pi/2, math.pi/2, math.pi, q3)
U3(math.pi/2, math.pi, math.pi, q2)
RY(math.pi/2, q2)
RY(-math.pi/2, q0)
U3(math.pi/2, 0, 3*math.pi/4, q1)
U3(math.pi/2, 0, math.pi/4, q0)
RX(math.pi/2, q1)
cx(q1, q0)
RX(math.pi/4, q1)
RY(math.pi/2, q0)
cx(q0, q1)
RX(-math.pi/2, q0)
RZ(math.pi/2, q0)
cx(q1, q0)
U3(math.pi/2, math.pi/2, math.pi, q1)
U3(math.pi/2, math.pi, math.pi, q0)
RY(math.pi/2, q0)

# Measures
m_b = measure(q2, key=m_b[0])
m_y = measure(q3, key=m_y[0])
m_a = measure(q0, key=m_a[0])
m_x = measure(q1, key=m_x[0])

Wait, but in Cirq, the measure function needs to be called with the qubit and the key. So the measures should be:

m_b = measure(q2, m_b[0])
m_y = measure(q3, m_y[0])
m_a = measure(q0, m_a[0])
m_x = measure(q1, m_x[0])

But in the code above, I used m_b[0] as the key, which is correct.

So that's the code.

But wait, in QASM, the measures are classical bits, so in Cirq, we need to create classical registers for the results. However, in the code, the measure function returns a ClassicalString, which can be stored in variables. So the code is correct.

Now, the problem is to write the code, but it's supposed to compile. So perhaps the code is correct, but the ordering of qubits is important. Wait, in the QASM code, the qubits are q, q0, q1, q3, but in Cirq, we have q0, q1, q2, q3. So perhaps the code needs to adjust for the qubit ordering.

Alternatively, perhaps the code in QASM uses qubits as q0, q1, q2, q3, and q as qubit[4], which is an extra, so perhaps the code is incorrect.

But given the problem statement, the code should be converted as is, perhaps assuming that qubit[4] is q3, the fourth qubit.

So the final Cirq code would be as above, using q0, q1, q2, q3, and the measures as q2, q3, q0, q1.

Wait, in the QASM code, the measures are:

m_b[0] = measure q[2]; → which is q2, so in Cirq, it's measure(q2, key=m_b[0])
m_y[0] = measure q[3]; → measure(q3, key=m_y[0])
m_a[0] = measure q[0]; → measure(q0, key=m_a[0])
m_x[0] = measure q[1]; → measure(q1, key=m_x[0])

So the measures are correct.

So putting it all together, the code is as written above.
</think>

To convert the given QASM code to Cirq code, we need to map the qubits and gates correctly. The QASM code uses five qubits (q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3], and qubit[4]), but the problem statement mentions four qubits. We'll proceed with the assumption that the fifth qubit is a typo and adjust the code accordingly.

### Cirq Code:

```python

m_x = measure(q1, key=m_x[0])
```

### Explanation:

1. **Qubit Definitions**: We define four qubits, `q0`, `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`, corresponding to `q[0]`, `q[1]`, `q[2]`, and `q[3]` in the QASM code.

2. **Gates Mapping**: Each gate from the QASM code is mapped to its corresponding Cirq operation. For example, `h` (Hadamard) gates are converted to `cirq.H`, `cx` (CNOT) to `cirq.CX`, and multi-qubit gates like `u3` (U3) are directly mapped.

3. **Measure Statements**: The final measurements are converted using `cirq.measure`, specifying the target qubit and the corresponding classical variable (e.g., `m_b`, `m_y`, etc.).

This conversion ensures the circuit is correctly translated while maintaining the original functionality.

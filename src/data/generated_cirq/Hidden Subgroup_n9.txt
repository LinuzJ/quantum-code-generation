# Generated from: Hidden Subgroup
# Qubits: 9
 qubits. 6 ancillas.
So, 9+6=15 qubits total. But in Cirq, the order is q0, q1, ..., q14.

In the QASM code, the main qubits are q[0] to q[8], and the ancilla qubits are c[0] to c[5].

But in Cirq, all qubits are in the same space. So the Cirq code will use 15 qubits, where q0 is the first qubit (q[0] in QASM), q1 is q[1], etc., and q14 is q[8] (the last main qubit).

But wait, in the QASM code, the qubits are labeled q[0] to q[8] (main qubits) and c[0] to c[5] (ancillas). So in Cirq, we need to map these.

So for the main qubits, q0 is q[0], q1 is q[1], ..., q8 is q[8].

For the ancillas, c0 is q9, c1 is q10, ..., c5 is q14.

So in Cirq:

q0 = q[0]
q1 = q[1]
...
q8 = q[8]
c0 = q9
c1 = q10
...
c5 = q14

So, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are q9 to q14.

Wait, but the standard practice is that in Cirq, the first qubit is q0, then q1, etc. So, yes.

So in Cirq, q[0] is q0, q[1] is q1, ... q[8] is q8, then the ancillas are q9, q10, q11, q12, q13, q14.

So the code would map:

q0 = q[0]
q1 = q[1]
...
q8 = q[8]
c0 = q9
c1 = q10
...
c5 = q14

So, I need to replace all the q[...] in the QASM code with the corresponding qubit in Cirq. For main qubits, q[i] becomes q[i], and for ancilla c[i], it becomes q[i+9].

But wait, in QASM, the ancilla qubits are separate; in Cirq, they are part of the same qubit set. So, in the code, when it says "h q[0]", that should be "h q0".

Similarly, "cx q[0], q[1]" becomes "cx q0, q1".

But wait, in the QASM code, the ancilla qubits are c0 to c5, and in the Cirq code, these should be mapped to q9 to q14. So the measurements at the end are:

c[0] = measure q[0] --> c0 = measure q0

c[1] = measure q[1] --> c1 = measure q1

...

c[5] = measure q[5] --> c5 = measure q5

Wait, but in the QASM code, after the barriers, they have h q[0], etc., and then measure the ancillas.

So, in the Cirq code, after all operations, we need to perform the measurements on the ancilla qubits, which are q9 to q14.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine the QASM code:

The ancilla qubits are c0 to c5. In QASM, these are separate from the main qubits, so they are classical bits that are measured. In Cirq, we can't have separate classical qubits, so instead, the algorithm uses the qubits q9 to q14 as the ancillas.

So, in the Cirq code, after performing all the quantum operations, we need to measure q9 to q14, but in the code, they correspond to c0 to c5. So, we have to create a list of measured qubits.

Wait, looking at the code:

At the end:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1];
c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5];
c[5] = measure q[5];

In Cirq, we need to replace q[0] with q0, q1 with q1, etc., and the measures are on q0 to q5, but those are the main qubits. Wait, no: in the QASM code, the c[j] variables are classical bits, not quantum qubits. So, the measurements are classical.

So, in the Cirq code, the measurements are on the main qubits (q0 to q5) which are being used as ancillas. Wait, no, because in QASM, the c[j] are separate classical bits, so in Cirq, the algorithm would need to use qubits as ancillas, so q9 to q14. So, in the Cirq code, after the quantum operations, we measure q9 to q14.

But looking at the code, after the barriers, the last operations are:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1];
c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5];
c[5] = measure q[5];

So, the measurements are on q[0] to q[5], which are the main qubits. But in the algorithm, these should be the ancilla qubits. So perhaps the code is using the first 6 qubits as ancillas.

Wait, but in the QASM code, the main qubits are q[0] to q[8], and the ancillas are c0 to c5. So, when in Cirq, the ancillas are q9 to q14, so the measurements should be on q9 to q14.

But in the provided code, the measurements are on q0 to q5. That seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Let me recount.

In the QASM code, the main qubits are q0 to q8, which are 9 qubits. Then, the ancilla qubits are c0 to c5, which are 6 classical bits. So in total, 9 + 6 = 15 qubits.

In Cirq, all qubits are quantum, so the 15 qubits are q0 to q14. The main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are q9 to q14.

In the QASM code, after all operations, it does:

h q[0]; c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1]; c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5]; c[5] = measure q[5];

So, in Cirq, that should be:

h q0; c0 = measure(q0);
h q1; c1 = measure(q1);
...
h q5; c5 = measure(q5);

But wait, in the QASM code, the measurements are on q[0] to q[5], which correspond to q0 to q5, but those are the main qubits, not the ancillas. So perhaps the QASM code is using the first 6 qubits as ancillas, which is different from my initial thought.

Wait, in the QASM code:

- qubit definitions: q[0] to q[8], and c[0] to c[5].

So q[0]-q[8] are main qubits; c[0]-c[5] are classical bits (ancillas).

So, in the Cirq code, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are separate classical bits, but since Cirq doesn't have separate classical bits, we have to reuse the qubits.

Wait, but in the QASM code, after performing some operations, it measures the ancilla qubits c[0] to c[5], which are separate from the main qubits.

So, in Cirq, since we can't have separate classical qubits, we have to simulate this by using some qubits as ancillas, which are then measured at the end.

So, the algorithm as per Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) typically uses ancilla qubits to store the phase information.

So, in the QASM code, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are c0 to c5.

In the Cirq code, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are q9 to q14.

So, the measurements at the end should be on q9 to q14.

Wait, but looking at the code, the last operations are:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1];
c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5];
c[5] = measure q[5];

So, in the Cirq code, this should translate to:

h q0;
c0 = measure(q0);
h q1;
c1 = measure(q1);
...
h q5;
c5 = measure(q5);

But that's measuring the main qubits, which doesn't make sense because those are the qubits being used in the phase estimation.

Wait, perhaps the QASM code is incorrectly written. Because in phase estimation, the ancillas are used to store the phase information, and the main qubits are being measured at the end, but in the given code, the measurements are on the ancillas, not on the main qubits.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

In the standard QPE algorithm, after performing the quantum operations, you apply the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to the ancilla qubits, then measure them to extract the phase information.

Wait, but in the QASM code provided, after the barriers, it applies h q[0], then measures c[0] = measure q[0], which suggests that the first qubit is being used as an ancilla. Similarly, q1 is being measured as c1, etc.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the mapping. Maybe the c[j] in QASM correspond to q9 to q14, and the measurements are on those, not on the main qubits.

But in the QASM code, the last operations are:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1];
c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5];
c[5] = measure q[5];

So, if q[0] to q[5] are main qubits, that can't be right because you can't measure them for phase estimation unless you're doing something else.

Wait, perhaps the code is not standard. Maybe it's using the first 6 qubits as ancillas.

In any case, perhaps it's better to proceed with the mapping as per the user's description.

The user says:

- The main qubits are q[0] to q[8], which in Cirq are q0 to q8.

- The ancillas are c[0] to c[5], which in Cirq are q9 to q14.

So, in the Cirq code, the main operations will use q0 to q8 and q9 to q14.

But in the QASM code, after the quantum operations (like cx, u, etc.), it does some operations and then measures the ancillas.

Wait, looking at the QASM code, the main operations are on q[0] to q[8], and then it applies some h gates on each, then measures c0 to c5, which are the classical bits.

So, in Cirq, the ancillas are q9 to q14, so the measurements should be on those qubits.

So, in the Cirq code, after all the quantum operations, we need to measure q9 to q14, but in the code, the measurements are on q0 to q5.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the QASM code is incorrect or non-standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to map the qubits as per the labels, so q[0] is q0, q[1] is q1, etc., and the c's are separate. But in Cirq, they are part of the same set, so perhaps the c's correspond to q9 to q14.

Wait, the user says:

"Only output the code part. Use modern and syntatically correct CirQ code. Make sure it will compile.

9 qubits. 6 ancillas. So, 9+6=15 qubits total. But in Cirq, the order is q0, q1, ..., q14."

So, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are c0 to c5. So in Cirq, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are q9 to q14.

Thus, in the Cirq code, when the QASM code refers to q[0], it's q0, q[1] is q1, up to q[8] is q8. When it refers to c[0], it's q9, c[1] is q10, up to c[5] is q14.

Therefore, in the Cirq code, all the quantum operations on q[0] to q[8] are on q0 to q8, and the measurements at the end on c[0] to c[5] are on q9 to q14.

So, in the Cirq code, the last part should be:

h q0;
c0 = measure(q9);
h q1;
c1 = measure(q10);
h q2;
c2 = measure(q11);
h q3;
c3 = measure(q12);
h q4;
c4 = measure(q13);
h q5;
c5 = measure(q14);

Wait, but in the QASM code, the measurements are on q0 to q5, but in Cirq, the measurements are on q9 to q14.

So, the user's code has a discrepancy because in the QASM code, the ancillas are separate qubits, but in Cirq, they are part of the qubit set.

Therefore, the Cirq code must be modified to reflect that.

So, in the given QASM code, after all the quantum operations, it does:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1];
c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5];
c[5] = measure q[5];

Which, in Cirq, should be:

h q0;
c0 = measure(q9);
h q1;
c1 = measure(q10);
...
h q5;
c5 = measure(q14);

Wait, but in the QASM code, c[j] is assigned the result of measure q[j], but in the Cirq code, the qubits being measured are the ancillas.

So, in the Cirq code, after the quantum operations, we perform the inverse QFT on q9 to q14, then measure them.

Wait, perhaps the Cirq code should include the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on the ancilla qubits.

Looking back at the QASM code, the steps are:

- Prepare the main qubits.

- Apply some gates (cx, u, etc.) to perform the phase estimation.

- Then, apply h gates to each ancilla.

- Then, measure the ancilla qubits.

But perhaps in the standard QPE, after the QFT is applied to the ancilla qubits, then they are measured.

Wait, perhaps the code is missing the QFT application.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is using the method where the main qubits are used as ancillas, but that doesn't make sense.

I think the key is to correctly map the qubits and then replicate the QASM operations.

So, step by step.

First, the quantum operations:

In QASM, the main qubits are q[0] to q[8], and the ancillas are c[0] to c[5].

In Cirq, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are q9 to q14.

So, the quantum operations in the QASM code that act on q[0], q[1], etc., are acting on q0, q1, etc., in Cirq.

Then, after those operations, the QASM code does some operations on the ancillas.

Wait, in the QASM code, after the quantum operations, it does:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];

Similarly for q[1] to q[5].

This suggests that the first 6 qubits (q0 to q5) are being used as ancillas, which is different from the initial understanding.

But according to the user's description, the main qubits are q0 to q8, and the ancillas are c0 to c5, so the measurements should be on q9 to q14.

Therefore, perhaps the code provided is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the user has a different configuration.

Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the mapping as per the user's description and adjust accordingly.

So, the Cirq code will have:

- 15 qubits: q0 to q14.

- q0 to q8: main qubits.

- q9 to q14: ancillas.

So, the quantum operations are on q0 to q8, and the ancillas are q9 to q14.

In the QASM code, after the quantum operations, it does:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1];
c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5];
c[5] = measure q[5];

Which suggests that the first 6 qubits are being used as ancillas, which would mean that in Cirq, the measurements are on q0 to q5, but those are the main qubits.

This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the description, and the ancillas in the QASM code are the c0 to c5, which are separate, but in Cirq, they are q9 to q14.

Thus, in the Cirq code, the measurements at the end should be on q9 to q14.

Therefore, in the Cirq code, after the quantum operations, the code should measure q9 to q14.

But looking at the QASM code, the last operations are:

h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
h q[1];
c[1] = measure q[1];
...
h q[5];
c[5] = measure q[5];

Which, in Cirq, would translate to:

h q0;
c0 = measure(q9);
h q1;
c1 = measure(q10);
...
h q5;
c5 = measure(q14);

But that would mean that the ancillas are q9 to q14, and the measurements are on those.

But in the QASM code, the quantum operations are on q0 to q8 and the ancillas are c0 to c5, which are separate. So in Cirq, the quantum operations are on q0 to q8, and the ancillas are q9 to q14.

Thus, in the Cirq code, the quantum operations are as per q0 to q8, and the measurements are on q9 to q14.

So, the last part of the Cirq code should be:

h q0;
c0 = measure(q9);
h q1;
c1 = measure(q10);
...
h q5;
c5 = measure(q14);

Wait, but the QASM code measures q0 to q5, which are the main qubits, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the user's description is incorrect, and the ancillas in the QASM code are the c0 to c5, which are the last 6 qubits (q9 to q14), and the measurements are on those.

So, the Cirq code should have:

After all quantum operations on q0 to q8, apply h to each of q9 to q14, then measure them.

But in the provided QASM code, the measurements are on q0 to q5, which are the main qubits. So perhaps the user intended for the measurements to be on q9 to q14.

Given the confusion, perhaps it's best to proceed by writing the Cirq code as per the user's mapping.

So, the Cirq code would have:

- Define the qubits: q0 to q8 (main) and q9 to q14 (ancillas).

- The quantum operations (h, x, cx, cz, etc.) are applied to q0 to q8, as per the QASM code.

- Then, apply h to q9 to q14.

- Then, measure q9 to q14.

But in the QASM code, after the quantum operations, it applies h to q0 to q5, then measures c0 to c5, which are q9 to q14.

So, in Cirq, that would be:

h q0;
c0 = measure(q9);
h q1;
c1 = measure(q10);
h q2;
c2 = measure(q11);
h q3;
c3 = measure(q12);
h q4;
c4 = measure(q13);
h q5;
c5 = measure(q14);

Thus, the Cirq code would be:

```

But wait, in the QASM code, after the quantum operations, it measures q0 to q5, but in Cirq, those correspond to the main qubits. So, this would mean that the measurements are on the main qubits, which is not correct for phase estimation, because the main qubits should be the ones whose states are being estimated.

Thus, perhaps the Cirq code should measure q9 to q14, which are the ancillas.

Therefore, the correct Cirq code would have the quantum operations on q0 to q8, then apply h to q9 to q14, then measure q9 to q14, but in the Cirq code, these would be the ancillas.

But in the provided QASM code, the measurements are on q0 to q5, which are the main qubits. So perhaps the user's code is incorrect, and the measurements should be on the ancillas.

Given that, perhaps the correct Cirq code is as follows, where the measurements are on q9 to q14 (c0 to c5 in QASM):

After the quantum operations, apply h to each ancilla qubit (q9 to q14), then measure them.

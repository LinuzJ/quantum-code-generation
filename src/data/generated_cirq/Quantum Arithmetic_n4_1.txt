Each qubit undergoes Hadamard gate H, then is measured in the computational basis, resulting in a random n-bit string.

The goal is to create the following circuit:
- Apply H to each qubit.
- Measure each qubit in computational basis.
Thus, the resulting state is a random n-bit string, suitable for sampling.

Now, I need to write the Cirq code that accomplishes this.

Circuit:

1. Create four qubits.
2. Apply a Hadamard gate to each qubit.
3. Measure each qubit in the standard basis (computational basis).

So, the steps are:

- Define qubits: q0, q1, q2, q3.
- For each qubit, apply H.
- Measure each qubit.

But in Cirq, the qubits are created in the order they are defined, and the gates are applied in the same order. So, if I create four qubits and apply H to each in order, then the code would look like:

q0, q1, q2, q3 = [q0, q1, q2, q3]
for q in [q0, q1, q2, q3]:
    H(q)
then measure each.

Alternatively, in Cirq, you can write it as:

q0 = create_qubit()
q1 = create_qubit()
q2 = create_qubit()
q3 = create_qubit()
H(q0)
H(q1)
H(q2)
H(q3)
c = H(q0)
d = H(q1)
e = H(q2)
f = H(q3)
result = circuit(q0, c)
and then measure each qubit.

Wait, no, actually in Cirq, you need to create the qubits first and then apply the gates. The correct way is:

q = QuantumRegister(4)
q0, q1, q2, q3 = q

Then, H(q0), H(q1), H(q2), H(q3)

Then, measure each qubit.

So, the code would be:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
q0, q1, q2, q3 = circuit

# Apply H to each qubit
H(q0)
H(q1)
H(q2)
H(q3)

# Measure each qubit
result = circuit.measure(q0)
result = circuit.measure(q1)
result = circuit.measure(q2)
result = circuit.measure(q3)

But wait, in Cirq, you can do this more concisely. Like:

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
circuit.apply(H, [circuit[0], circuit[1], circuit[2], circuit[3]])

But I don't think that's correct. Because the apply method in QuantumRegister requires the gates and the qubits as arguments, but H is a function that takes a single qubit or a list of qubits.

Wait, maybe:

circuit.apply(H, [circuit[0], circuit[1], circuit[2], circuit[3]])

Yes, that would apply H to each of the four qubits.

Alternatively, for each qubit in the register:

for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])

Yes, that should work.

So, putting it all together:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

# Create a circuit with 4 qubits
circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
# Apply Hadamard to each qubit
for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])
# Measure each qubit
measurements = []
for q in circuit:
    measurements.append(circuit.measure(q))
# The measurements variable will contain the results of each qubit
print(measurements)

Wait, but in QASM code, each measurement is assigned to a classical variable. In Cirq, when you measure a qubit, you get a sample, which is a probability or a bit.

But in the QASM code, the user is measuring each qubit and storing the result in c[0], c[1], etc. So in Cirq, we just need to measure each qubit, and the results will be a list of samples.

But in the code, do we need to assign each measurement to a variable or just collect the results? In the provided QASM code, it's assigning the results to classical variables c[0] to c[3], which are bits.

In Cirq, after applying the H gates and measuring, the results will be a list where each element is either 0 or 1, depending on the measurement outcome.

So, the code to generate is:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])
result = circuit.measure_all()
print(result)

Wait, does QuantumRegister have a method to measure all qubits at once? Let me check.

In Cirq, the QuantumRegister class has a method called 'measure' which takes a qubit, and 'measure_all' which measures all qubits and returns a list of results.

Yes, so 'measure_all()' returns a list of measurement results, each for one qubit in the register.

So, the code can be written as:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])
result = circuit.measure_all()
print(result)

That should generate a list of four bits, each 0 or 1, which is the random number string.

Alternatively, if you want to measure each qubit individually and assign them to variables, you can loop through and measure each:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])

# Measure each qubit and store the results
measurements = []
for q in circuit:
    measurements.append(circuit.measure(q))
print(measurements)

But in the QASM code, each measurement is assigned to a classical variable, but in Cirq, the measure method returns a sample, which is a single result.

So, the code could be as short as:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
circuit.apply(H, [circuit[0], circuit[1], circuit[2], circuit[3]])
result = circuit.measure_all()
print(result)

Or with a loop:

for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])

result = circuit.measure_all()
print(result)

Either way works.

I think the most concise way is to apply H to each qubit using a loop, then measure all at once.

So, the final code would be:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])
result = circuit.measure_all()
print(result)

But the user said to output the code part, so perhaps just the code without the print statements.

So, the code part would be:

from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

circuit = QuantumRegister(4)
for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])
result = circuit.measure_all()

But wait, in the QASM code, the qubits are named q[0], q[1], etc., but in Cirq, the QuantumRegister's qubits are accessed via circuit[0], circuit[1], etc., so the code is correct as above.

Yes, that should be the correct code.

To convert the provided QASM code into Cirq code, we need to create a quantum circuit that applies a Hadamard gate to each of four qubits and then measures each in the computational basis. The resulting state will be a random n-bit string.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Import Necessary Modules**: We use the `cirq` library, specifically the `QuantumRegister` and `H` (Hadamard) gate classes.

2. **Create a Quantum Register**: We create a `QuantumRegister` with 4 qubits. This register will hold all our qubits and allow us to apply quantum operations on them.

3. **Apply Hadamard Gates**: Loop through each qubit in the register and apply the Hadamard gate to each one. The Hadamard gate is applied using the `apply` method, which takes the gate and a list of qubits to apply it to.

4. **Measure All Qubits**: After applying the Hadamard gates, we measure all qubits in the register. The `measure_all` method returns a list of measurement results, each corresponding to one qubit.

### Cirq Code:

```python
from cirq import QuantumRegister, H

# Create a circuit with 4 qubits
circuit = QuantumRegister(4)

# Apply Hadamard to each qubit
for q in circuit:
    circuit.apply(H, [q])

# Measure all qubits
result = circuit.measure_all()
```

### Explanation:

- **QuantumRegister Initialization**: `circuit = QuantumRegister(4)` creates a register with 4 qubits, labeled as `circuit[0]`, `circuit[1]`, `circuit[2]`, and `circuit[3]`.
  
- **Applying Hadamard Gates**: The loop `for q in circuit:` iterates over each qubit in the register. In each iteration, `circuit.apply(H, [q])` applies the `H` gate to the current qubit `q`.

- **Measuring Qubits**: The method `circuit.measure_all()` measures all qubits in the register and returns a list of their measurement results. Each result is either 0 or 1, representing the computational basis state of that qubit.

This code generates a random n-bit string suitable for sampling, as each qubit is measured in the standard computational basis after applying the Hadamard gate.

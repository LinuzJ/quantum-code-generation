        return self.a[1]
    
    def q_2(self):
        # ... and so on

        # and then use them accordingly.
    
    def build_circuit(self):
        # create the circuit
        circuit = Circuit()
        for i in range(self.width):
            circuit.add_qubit(self.a[i])
            circuit.add_qubit(self.b[i])
            circuit.add_qubit(self.q_in[i])
            # ... similarly for cin and other qubits
        # but perhaps the qubits are already provided, so maybe just create the circuit with all qubits
        # and then apply the gates accordingly.
        # now, let's think about the gates:
        # for each bit i, compute the sum and carry
        # the majority gate is used for the sum, and the ccx for carry
        # So, for each i, apply majority on cin, b_i, a_i to get the sum bit i
        # then apply cx to propagate carry
        # then ccx on a_i, b_i, sum to get the new a_i
        # So, the circuit should be built as follows:
        # for each i from 0 to width-1:
        # apply majority on cin, b[i], a[i] to get sum
        # apply cx from sum to a[i+1]
        # apply ccx on a[i], b[i], sum to get a[i]
        # Also, for the last carry, apply cx to a[n-1], cout
        # So, now in code:
        # iterate over each bit position i
        # create the qubits for each i
        # add the gates
        # Now, for the circuit:
        # Define each qubit as a gate, perhaps in a list
        # q_in is the input carry
        # q_out is the output carry
        # So, perhaps we can have:
        # qubits = [self.a[0], self.b[0], self.cin, self.cout]
        # but in Cirq, qubits are added in a certain order, and the circuit is built with their positions
        # perhaps a better approach is to create a list of all qubits involved in the circuit
        # and assign their indices accordingly.
        # Now, let's try to write the build_circuit function properly.
        # The circuit will have the following qubits:
        # for each i in 0..width-1:
        # a_i, b_i, cin_i (for i=0), and for i>0, maybe no?
        # Wait, the carry is being added as cin, so maybe the cin is a single qubit for all the width?
        # Wait, in the QASM code, cin is a qubit, and a and b are arrays of qubits. So in Cirq, we can model this as:
        # cin is a single qubit, and each a_i and b_i are individual qubits. So the circuit will have:
        # cin, a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}, cout.
        # So, the circuit is built as follows:
        # create a list of qubits in the order: cin, a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}, cout.
        # Then, for each i, apply the majority gate on cin, b_i, a_i to compute a_i and the carry.
        # Then, apply cx from a_i to a_{i+1} to propagate the carry.
        # Then, apply ccx on a_i, b_i, a_i to compute the new a_i.
        # So, in code:
        qubits = [cin, a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}, b0, b1, ..., b_{n-1}, cout]
        for i in 0..n-1:
            # apply majority on cin, b_i, a_i to get sum
            sum_q = majority(cin, b_i, a_i)
            # apply cx from sum to a_i+1
            if i < n-1:
                cx(sum_q, a_i_plus_1)
            # apply ccx on a_i, b_i, sum to compute new a_i
            ccx(a_i, b_i, sum_q)
        # then, apply cx from a_{n-1} to cout
        cx(a_{n-1}, cout)
        return circuit
        # but how to represent this in Cirq code, considering that a and b are lists of qubits.

        # So, in Cirq, each qubit in the circuit is represented as a separate qubit in the Circuit object.
        # So, the circuit is built by adding each qubit and then applying the gates between them.
        # Therefore, in the class, we need to have a list of qubits, each being an instance of Qubit.
        # So, in the __init__, we can initialize all the necessary qubits.
        # Then, in the build_circuit function, we can add the gates.
        # So, let's try to write the Cirq code step by step.

                    # Here's how the majority gate can be implemented:

                        # Compute the majority

                    # Add the sum qubit to the circuit
                    circuit.add_qubit(sum_q)
                    # Apply cx from sum_q to a_{i+1}
                    if i < self.width - 1:
                        cx(sum_q, self.a[i+1])
                    # Apply ccx on a_i, b_i, sum_q
                    ccx(self.a[i], self.b[i], sum_q)
                # Apply the final cx from a_{n-1} to cout
                cx(self.a[-1], self.cout)
                return circuit
        # Finally, the circuit is built and can be used with Cirq's Circuit
        return circuit
}
```
But in the code above, there's a problem. The majority gate is defined inside the build_circuit function, but in Cirq, you can't have a function defined inside another function in that way. So, I need to move the majority gate definition outside of the build_circuit method.

So, let's adjust that. Let's define the majority gate as a separate function or use a Cirq-built-in gate if possible. But since the majority gate is a custom three-qubit gate, we'll have to define it outside the class.

So, in the code, I'll define the majority gate as a global function or as a method.

Wait, but in Cirq, you can define gates using the @circuit decorator. So, perhaps I should define the majority gate outside the class.

Let me adjust the code accordingly.

First, in the Cirq code, we have to define the gates properly.

So, I'll define the majority gate as a function using the @circuit decorator, and then use it in the build_circuit method.

Also, the code needs to include the necessary imports and the QuantumRippleCarryAdder class.

Let me outline the correct structure.

1. Import necessary modules: Circuit, Qubit, X, CX, CCX, etc.

2. Define the majority gate as a custom gate.

3. Define the QuantumRippleCarryAdder class with the build_circuit method.

4. Ensure that the majority gate is properly defined so it can be used in the circuit.

Also, in the build_circuit method, when creating the majority gate, we need to pass the correct qubits.

Wait, in the current code, the majority function is taking q0, q1, q2 as parameters, but in the context of the circuit, the qubits are already part of the circuit, so perhaps I should not pass them as raw qubits but refer to them via their objects.

Wait, in the code, self.a[i] and self.b[i] are instances of Qubit, which are part of the circuit. So when I call majority(self.cin, self.b[i], self.a[i]), that should work as long as the majority gate is properly defined.

But in the current setup, the majority gate is defined inside the build_circuit function, which is inside the class. That's not allowed in Cirq.

So, I need to move the majority gate definition outside of the class.

Let me try to correct the code.

So, the corrected code would look like this:

First, define the majority gate outside the class.

@Circuit
def majority(q0, q1, q2):
    # Compute the majority
    if q0 == q1 == q2:
        return q0
    if q0 == q1:
        return q0
    if q0 == q2:
        return q0
    if q1 == q2:
        return q1
    return q2  # This case should not happen in our circuit

Then, in the build_circuit method, when applying the majority gate, it would use this function.

So, in the build_circuit method, I would have:

sum_q = majority(self.cin, self.b[i], self.a[i])

Now, in the code, the QuantumRippleCarryAdder class is supposed to be used with Cirq's Circuit. So, the build_circuit method should return the Circuit instance, which can be used elsewhere.

But in the initial code, the class is supposed to represent the quantum circuit. So, perhaps the build_circuit function is part of the class and returns the circuit.

Wait, no, the build_circuit function is a method of the class that constructs the circuit. So, in the code, the class's build_circuit method should return the Circuit instance.

Wait, in the initial code, the return circuit is outside the function, but that's not correct. Let's make sure that the build_circuit method returns the circuit.

So, in the code, after adding all the gates, the build_circuit method should return the circuit.

Additionally, in the code, the majority gate is defined outside the class.

Let me try to write the corrected code step by step.

First, the imports:

from cirq import (
    Circuit,
    Qubit,
    X,
    CX,
    CCX,
)

Then, define the majority gate:

@Circuit
def majority(q0, q1, q2):
    # Compute the majority
    if q0 == q1 == q2:
        return q0
    if q0 == q1:
        return q0
    if q0 == q2:
        return q0
    if q1 == q2:
        return q1
    return q2  # This case should not happen in our circuit

Then, define the QuantumRippleCarryAdder class:

class QuantumRippleCarryAdder:
    def __init__(self, width):
        self.width = width
        # Initialize the qubits
        self.cin = Qubit()
        self.a = [Qubit() for _ in range(width)]
        self.b = [Qubit() for _ in range(width)]
        self.cout = Qubit()
        # Initialize the answer qubits
        self.ans = [CircuitRegister() for _ in range(width)]
    
    def build_circuit(self):
        circuit = Circuit()
        # Add all qubits to the circuit
        # Order: cin, a0, a1, ..., a(n-1), b0, b1, ..., b(n-1), cout
        qubits = [self.cin, self.a[0], self.a[1], ..., self.a[self.width-1], 
                   self.b[0], self.b[1], ..., self.b[self.width-1], self.cout]
        # Wait, but in Python, the ... is not valid syntax. So, I need to loop through the a and b qubits.
        qubits = []
        qubits.append(self.cin)
        for i in range(self.width):
            qubits.append(self.a[i])
            qubits.append(self.b[i])
        qubits.append(self.cout)
        # Now, for each i, apply the gates
        for i in range(self.width):
            # Apply majority on cin, b_i, a_i to compute sum
            sum_q = majority(self.cin, self.b[i], self.a[i])
            # Add the sum qubit to the circuit
            circuit.add_qubit(sum_q)
            # Apply cx from sum to a_i+1 if not last bit
            if i < self.width - 1:
                CX(sum_q, self.a[i+1])
            # Apply ccx on a_i, b_i, sum_q
            CCX(self.a[i], self.b[i], sum_q)
        # Apply final cx from a[-1] to cout
        CX(self.a[-1], self.cout)
        return circuit

Wait, but in the code, I need to make sure that the qubits are added correctly. Also, when applying the gates, the order matters. The CX gate takes two qubits and creates a controlled connection. So, when I apply CX(sum_q, self.a[i+1]), it means that sum_q is the control, and a[i+1] is the target.

Similarly, CCX is a three-qubit gate, where the first two are controls, and the third is the target. So, in CCX(self.a[i], self.b[i], sum_q), a[i] and b[i] are controls, and sum_q is the target.

I think this should correctly model the quantum ripple-carry adder.

Now, putting it all together, the corrected Cirq code is as follows.
```python
from cirq import (
    Circuit,
    Qubit,
    X,
    CX,
    CCX,
)

@Circuit
def majority(q0, q1, q2):
    if q0 == q1 == q2:
        return q0
    if q0 == q1:
        return q0
    if q0 == q2:
        return q0
    if q1 == q2:
        return q1
    return q2  # This case should not happen in our circuit

class QuantumRippleCarryAdder:
    def __init__(self, width):
        self.width = width
        self.cin = Qubit()
        self.a = [Qubit() for _ in range(width)]
        self.b = [Qubit() for _ in range(width)]
        self.cout = Qubit()
        self.ans = [CircuitRegister() for _ in range(width)]
    
    def build_circuit(self):
        circuit = Circuit()
        # Add all qubits to the circuit
        qubits = [self.cin]
        for i in range(self.width):
            qubits.append(self.a[i])
            qubits.append(self.b[i])
        qubits.append(self.cout)
        
        for i in range(self.width):
            # Apply majority gate for the sum
            sum_q = majority(self.cin, self.b[i], self.a[i])
            circuit.add_qubit(sum_q)
            
            # Apply CX to propagate carry
            if i < self.width - 1:
                CX(sum_q, self.a[i+1])
            
            # Apply CCX to compute the new a_i
            CCX(self.a[i], self.b[i], sum_q)
        
        # Apply final CX to output
        CX(self.a[-1], self.cout)
        return circuit
```

This code defines the quantum ripple-carry adder using Cirq. The `QuantumRippleCarryAdder` class initializes the necessary qubits and constructs the circuit by applying the majority and carry gates appropriately. The `build_circuit` method returns the Circuit instance which represents the entire quantum circuit.

Note: The `CircuitRegister` is used for the ans qubits, which are the outputs of the adder. Each `ans[i]` is a register that can be measured to get the result of the addition.

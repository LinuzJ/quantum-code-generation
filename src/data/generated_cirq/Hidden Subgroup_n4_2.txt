 qubits.

So, the task is to take the provided Qasm code and translate it into the corresponding Cirq code. Let's analyze the given Qasm code step by step to understand what each part does, then map it to Cirq's operations.

First, the circuit starts with including the standard gates and defines a custom gate `cu1`. Let's look at the `cu1` gate. It seems to be a multi-qubit gate because it has parameters p0, p0/2, etc. Looking at the code:

Inside the `cu1` gate, there are several operations:
- `u1(p0/2)` on q0
- `cx` between q0 and q1
- `u1(-p0/2)` on q1
- Another `cx` between q0 and q1
- `u1(p0/2)` on q1

This suggests that the `cu1` gate is a two-qubit gate where q0 is being manipulated, and q1 is being used as an auxiliary qubit. The operations seem to be similar to a controlled-U gate. However, since the gate is defined for q0 and q1, perhaps it's a controlled-U on q0 with a certain angle.

Next, let's look at the qubit declarations and the subsequent operations:

- 4 bits `c` (classical bits) and 4 qubits `q`.
- `x` gates on q[0] and q[2], which are Pauli X (bit flip) gates.
- A barrier between q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3], which is just a comment in Cirq and doesn't affect the circuit.
- `h` (Hadamard) on q[0].
- `cu1(pi/2)` on q1 and q0. From earlier, `cu1` is a two-qubit gate. So this applies a controlled-U on q1 (control) and q0 (target).
- `h` on q1.
- Then, on q2: `cu1(pi/4)` on q2 (control) and q0.
- Another `cu1(pi/2)` on q2 (control) and q1.
- `h` on q2.
- Then, on q3: `cu1(pi/8)`, `cu1(pi/4)`, `cu1(pi/2)` each on q3 and q0, q1, q2 respectively.
- `h` on q3.
- Finally, measure all qubits into classical registers `c[0]` to `c[3]`.

Now, mapping this to Cirq. In Cirq, the standard gates are defined with specific syntax. For example, the Hadamard gate is `H`, and controlled-U gates are defined with `CircuitOperation` or `C` for controlled.

But the custom gate `cu1` is a two-qubit gate, so in Cirq, we'll need to define it as a custom operation. However, Cirq doesn't support arbitrary gates by default; you have to create a class that inherits from `CircuitOperation` and defines the operation.

Wait, but the user only asked for the code part, so perhaps the custom gate can be represented with existing operations. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to map the `cu1` operations to known gates.

Wait, looking at the `cu1` gate's body:

- On q0: u1(p0/2) – which is a rotation around the z-axis by p0/2.
- Then a cx between q0 and q1.
- Then on q1: u1(-p0/2) – which is a rotation around the z-axis by -p0/2.
- Another cx.
- Then on q1: u1(p0/2) – same as the first u1 on q0.

Wait, perhaps `cu1` is a two-qubit gate where q0 is the target, and q1 is the control. The sequence on q0 is:

- Apply u1(p0/2)
- Apply cx (controlled-X) to q1
- Apply u1(-p0/2) to q1
- Apply cx again
- Apply u1(p0/2) to q1.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a controlled-U with some angle. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diagonal gate. Alternatively, maybe it's a rotation on q0 based on some operations involving q1.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to define the `cu1` gate in Cirq as a custom two-qubit operation, where it applies certain rotations.

Alternatively, perhaps the `cu1` operations can be represented using existing gates. For example, if the u1 is a rotation, and cx is a controlled-X, perhaps the sequence can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps `cu1` is a controlled-U gate where the U is a rotation about the z-axis by some angle. For example, if the control is q1 and target is q0, then applying u1(p0/2) on q0 when q1 is |1>, and doing nothing when q1 is |0>.

But the code inside `cu1` has more steps than just a controlled-U. Let's try to parse it step by step.

Inside `cu1`:
1. u1(p0/2) q0: rotate q0 by p0/2 around z.
2. cx q0, q1: apply X to q1 iff q0 is |1>.
3. u1(-p0/2) q1: rotate q1 by -p0/2 around z.
4. cx q0, q1: apply X to q1 again.
5. u1(p0/2) q1: rotate q1 by p0/2 around z.

Hmm. So perhaps when q1 is |1>, q0 undergoes some rotation. But the presence of multiple cx and u1 makes this more complex.

Wait, perhaps after steps 1-2-3-4-5, the effect is a certain rotation on q0 conditioned on q1.

Alternatively, maybe it's a controlled-U where when q1 is |1>, a specific operation is applied on q0. But the sequence of operations might be equivalent to a certain rotation.

But maybe instead of getting stuck here, I can proceed and then see if the `cu1` gate can be represented as a standard gate in Cirq or as a custom gate.

But since the user requires the code to compile, perhaps I need to represent this as a custom gate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or an approximation.

Wait, perhaps the `cu1` gate is similar to a controlled-S gate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the rest of the code and see.

After the `cu1` definition, the operations are:

x q[0];  -> apply Pauli X to q0
x q[2];  -> apply Pauli X to q2

barrier q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3];  -> no-op in Cirq

h q[0];  -> H applied to q0
cu1(pi/2) q[1], q[0];  -> controlled-U on q1 and q0 with angle pi/2
h q[1];  -> H on q1

Then for q2:
cu1(pi/4) q[2], q[0];  -> controlled-U on q2 and q0 with pi/4
cu1(pi/2) q[2], q[1];  -> controlled-U on q2 and q1 with pi/2
h q[2];  -> H on q2

For q3:
cu1(pi/8) q[3], q[0];  -> controlled-U on q3 and q0 with pi/8
cu1(pi/4) q[3], q[1];  -> controlled-U on q3 and q1 with pi/4
cu1(pi/2) q[3], q[2];  -> controlled-U on q3 and q2 with pi/2
h q[3];  -> H on q3

Finally, measurements.

So, perhaps the idea is to perform a quantum Fourier transform (as per the description). So the code is implementing a quantum Fourier transform on the 4 qubits.

In Cirq, the quantum Fourier transform can be implemented using the Hadamard and controlled-U operations, similar to how FFT is implemented.

In QASM, the standard approach is to apply H gates, then for each qubit, apply a controlled-U with an increasing angle. For example, the first qubit may have U(pi/2), the second U(pi/4), etc., depending on the desired transform.

So perhaps the given code is implementing such a transform.

But let's try to map each operation step by step.

First, the initial qubit rotations:

- q0 and q2 are flipped with X.

Then, q0 is Hadamarded. Then a controlled-U(pi/2) on q0 and q1.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. q0 and q2 are X'ed (flipped).
2. q0 is H applied.
3. controlled-U(pi/2) on q0 (target) and q1 (control): So if q1 is |1>, then apply a rotation of pi/2 on q0.
4. q1 is H applied.
5. For q2: controlled-U(pi/4) on q2 (control) and q0 (target). So if q2 is |1>, apply U(pi/4) on q0.
6. Then controlled-U(pi/2) on q2 (control) and q1 (target).
7. q2 is H applied.
8. For q3: controlled-U(pi/8) on q3 (control) and q0 (target).
9. controlled-U(pi/4) on q3 and q1.
10. controlled-U(pi/2) on q3 and q2.
11. q3 is H applied.
12. Measure all qubits.

So, perhaps the idea is that after applying X and H on certain qubits, and controlled-U operations with different angles, we are preparing the state for a Fourier transform.

But in Cirq, the standard approach for Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) involves:

For each qubit i from 0 to n-1:
- Apply H on qubit i
- Apply C(U(2^i * pi/2)), where U is a rotation of 2^i * pi/2.

Wait, but in the given code, the angles are different. Let's see:

For q0:
- After X, H is applied.
- Then a controlled-U(pi/2) on q0 and q1.

For q1:
- After H, a controlled-U(pi/2) on q0 and q1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is that for each qubit (after X), we apply H and then a series of controlled-U operations with increasing angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the given code is implementing a specific version of QFT, possibly with a different basis.

But regardless, to translate this into Cirq, I need to figure out the equivalent operations.

First, the `cu1` gate: in QASM, it's a two-qubit gate that applies certain rotations and c-x operations. Since Cirq allows defining custom gates, I can create a class for `cu1` that applies the sequence of operations as per the definition.

But perhaps it's better to see if `cu1` can be represented with known operations.

Looking at the `cu1` gate again:

It's a two-qubit gate acting on q0 and q1. The operations are:

1. u1(p0/2) on q0: Rotation around z by p0/2.
2. cx q0, q1: Apply X to q1 if q0 is |1>.
3. u1(-p0/2) on q1: Rotation around z by -p0/2.
4. cx q0, q1: Apply X again.
5. u1(p0/2) on q1: Rotation around z by p0/2.

This seems like a controlled-U where the angle is determined by p0. The sequence of u1 and cx operations might be equivalent to some rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a rotation on q0 conditioned on q1. Let me try to compute the overall effect.

Suppose q1 is |1>:

- Apply u1(p0/2) to q0: rotation by theta = p0/2 around z.
- Then apply cx: so q1 becomes |0>.
- Then apply u1(-p0/2) to q1: since q1 is |0>, nothing happens because u1 acts on |0> as identity (since rotation around z only affects |0> and |1> states).
Wait, no: u1(theta) applied to |0> would give cos(theta)|0> - i sin(theta)|1>. So it does affect |0> and |1>.

Wait, but after the first cx, q1 is |0>, so applying u1(-p0/2) to q1 would rotate it by -p0/2.

Then apply cx again: q0 is in state after rotation, and applying cx to q1 (which is |0>) would flip it to |1>.

Then apply u1(p0/2) to q1, which is now |1>.

So overall, for q1=|1>:

- q0 is rotated by p0/2.
- q1 is first rotated by p0/2, then flipped via cx, then rotated by -p0/2, then flipped again, then rotated by p0/2.

This seems complicated, but perhaps it simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence is equivalent to a controlled-U on q1 (control) and q0 (target) with a specific angle.

Let me try to see what the combined operation is.

Suppose we have a two-qubit system, with q0 as target and q1 as control.

The operations are:

1. u1(theta) on target q0.
2. cx q0, q1.
3. u1(-theta) on q1.
4. cx q0, q1.
5. u1(theta) on q1.

Let me represent each operation as a matrix and see the composite effect.

But this might be too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the effect for q1=|1> and q1=|0> separately.

Case 1: q1 = |1>:

After step 1: q0 is rotated by theta.
After step 2: q1 becomes |0>.
After step 3: q1 is rotated by -theta. But since q1 is |0>, the rotation will be cos(-theta)|0> -i sin(-theta)|1> = |0> + i sin(theta)|1>.
Wait, but after step 3, q1 is |0> + i sin(theta)|1>.
Then step 4: cx on q0 (rotated by theta) and q1. So q1 becomes |1> if q0 is |1>, but q0 isn't necessarily |1>. Alternatively, cx applies X to q1 iff q0 is |1>.

Wait, but q0 has been rotated. So if q0 is |1>, then q1 will be flipped.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to accept that `cu1` is a custom gate and proceed to define it in Cirq as a custom operation.

So, in Cirq, I can create a class like this:

class Cu1Gate(CircuitOperation):
    def __init__(self, theta, q0, q1):
        super().__init__(theta, [q0, q1])
        self.theta = theta
        self.q0 = q0
        self.q1 = q1

    def _circuit(self, q):
        # Define the operations
        theta = self.theta
        q0 = self.q0
        q1 = self.q1

        # Apply u1(theta) on q0
        op1 = U(theta)
        q0 = op1(q0)

        # Apply CX between q0 and q1
        q0, q1 = CNOT(q0, q1)(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(-theta) on q1
        op2 = U(-theta)
        q1 = op2(q1)

        # Apply CX again
        q0, q1 = CNOT(q0, q1)(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(theta) on q1
        op3 = U(theta)
        q1 = op3(q1)

        return q0, q1

But wait, the U gate in Cirq is defined as U(theta), which applies a rotation around z by theta. So the above code would implement the sequence of operations as per the `cu1` gate.

But perhaps in Cirq, it's better to use the built-in `U` gate and `CNOT` for the cx operations.

Once the `Cu1Gate` is defined, the rest of the code can be translated.

So, the steps after the `cu1` definition are:

- Apply X on q0 and q2.
- Apply H on q0.
- Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q1.
- Apply H on q1.
- For q2: Apply Cu1(pi/4) on q0 and q2, then Cu1(pi/2) on q1 and q2, then H on q2.
- For q3: Apply Cu1(pi/8) on q0 and q3, Cu1(pi/4) on q1 and q3, Cu1(pi/2) on q2 and q3, then H on q3.
- Finally, measure all qubits.

So, in Cirq, the code would involve applying these operations in order.

But wait, the initial X gates on q0 and q2 are straightforward: `X(q0)` and `X(q2)`.

The H gates are `H(q0)`, `H(q1)`, etc.

The `Cu1` gates are defined as above.

Now, let's structure the code.

First, the custom gate:

class Cu1Gate(CircuitOperation):
    def __init__(self, theta, q0, q1):
        super().__init__(theta, [q0, q1])
        self.theta = theta
        self.q0 = q0
        self.q1 = q1

    def _circuit(self, q):
        theta = self.theta
        q0 = self.q0
        q1 = self.q1

        # Apply u1(theta) on q0
        u1 = U(theta)
        q0 = u1(q0)

        # Apply CX between q0 and q1
        cx = CNOT()
        q0, q1 = cx(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(-theta) on q1
        u_neg = U(-theta)
        q1 = u_neg(q1)

        # Apply CX again
        q0, q1 = cx(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(theta) on q1
        q1 = u1(q1)

        return q0, q1

Then, in the main code:

q = QuantumRegister(4)
c = ClassicalRegister(4)

# Apply X on q0 and q2
X(q[0])
X(q[2])

# Apply H on q0
H(q[0])

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q1
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply H on q1
H(q[1])

# Apply Cu1(pi/4) on q0 and q2
Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q1 and q2
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply H on q2
H(q[2])

# Apply Cu1(pi/8) on q0 and q3
Cu1Gate(pi/8, q[0], q[3]) q[0], q[3]

# Apply Cu1(pi/4) on q1 and q3
Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q2 and q3
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

# Apply H on q3
H(q[3])

# Measure all qubits
c[0] = Measure(q[0])
c[1] = Measure(q[1])
c[2] = Measure(q[2])
c[3] = Measure(q[3])

Wait, but in Cirq, the `Measure` function is used as `Measure(q)` which returns a ClassicalRegister. So each measurement is stored in the `c` register.

But in the code above, each `Measure(q[i])` is stored as `c[i]`.

But wait, in the original Qasm code, the measurements are done in sequence, which in Cirq would correspond to measuring each qubit and storing the result in the classical register in order.

So the code seems correct.

However, I need to make sure that the order of applying operations is correct. For example, the `Cu1Gate` operations are applied before any H gates on the same qubit.

Wait, looking back at the original code:

After X q0, H q0 is applied. Then Cu1(pi/2) q0, q1.

So in Cirq, the order is:

X(q0), then H(q0), then Cu1(pi/2)(q0, q1).

Which seems correct.

But wait, the `Cu1Gate` as defined applies multiple operations: u1(theta), cx, u1(-theta), cx, u1(theta). So each `Cu1Gate` call applies all those steps.

So the code seems correct.

Now, checking the rest:

For q2, after X and H, we apply Cu1(pi/4) on q0 and q2, then Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q1, then H on q2.

In Cirq:

Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

Then:

Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

H(q[2])

For q3:

Cu1Gate(pi/8, q[0], q[3]) q[0], q[3]

Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

H(q[3])

Yes, that's the same as the Qasm code.

Now, the final step is to write all of this in a single Cirq script that can be run.

But I need to make sure that all the operations are correctly applied in the right order and that the custom gate is properly defined.

Putting it all together:

First, include the necessary imports.

But in the Qasm code, it includes "stdgates.inc", which in Cirq would just be the standard gates. So we don't need to include any headers.

So the full Cirq code would be:

from cirq import ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister, H, CNOT, U, Measure, CircuitOperation

class Cu1Gate(CircuitOperation):
    def __init__(self, theta, q0, q1):
        super().__init__(theta, [q0, q1])
        self.theta = theta
        self.q0 = q0
        self.q1 = q1

    def _circuit(self, q):
        theta = self.theta
        q0 = self.q0
        q1 = self.q1

        # Apply u1(theta) on q0
        u1 = U(theta)
        q0 = u1(q0)

        # Apply CX between q0 and q1
        cx = CNOT()
        q0, q1 = cx(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(-theta) on q1
        u_neg = U(-theta)
        q1 = u_neg(q1)

        # Apply CX again
        q0, q1 = cx(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(theta) on q1
        q1 = u1(q1)

        return q0, q1

q = QuantumRegister(4)
c = ClassicalRegister(4)

# Apply X on q0 and q2
X(q[0])
X(q[2])

# Apply H on q0
H(q[0])

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q1
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply H on q1
H(q[1])

# Apply Cu1(pi/4) on q0 and q2
Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q1
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply H on q2
H(q[2])

# Apply Cu1(pi/8) on q0 and q3
Cu1Gate(pi/8, q[0], q[3]) q[0], q[3]

# Apply Cu1(pi/4) on q0 and q1
Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q2
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

# Apply H on q3
H(q[3])

# Measure all qubits
c[0] = Measure(q[0])
c[1] = Measure(q[1])
c[2] = Measure(q[2])
c[3] = Measure(q[3])

But wait, in Cirq, the `Measure` function returns a ClassicalRegister, so each `c[i]` is assigned the result of measuring `q[i]`. This should correctly capture the classical measurements.

I think this code should compile and correctly implement the Quantum Fourier Transform as described.
</think>

To convert the provided QASM code to Cirq, we analyze each part of the code, map QASM operations to Cirq's equivalent gates, and define any necessary custom operations. Here's the breakdown:

### Custom Gate Definition
The `cu1` gate is a custom two-qubit gate. We define it in Cirq to apply the sequence of operations specified in the QASM code.

```python
from cirq import ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister, H, CNOT, U, Measure, CircuitOperation

class Cu1Gate(CircuitOperation):
    def __init__(self, theta, q0, q1):
        super().__init__(theta, [q0, q1])
        self.theta = theta
        self.q0 = q0
        self.q1 = q1

    def _circuit(self, q):
        theta = self.theta
        q0 = self.q0
        q1 = self.q1

        # Apply u1(theta) on q0
        u1 = U(theta)
        q0 = u1(q0)

        # Apply CX between q0 and q1
        cx = CNOT()
        q0, q1 = cx(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(-theta) on q1
        u_neg = U(-theta)
        q1 = u_neg(q1)

        # Apply CX again
        q0, q1 = cx(q0, q1)

        # Apply u1(theta) on q1
        q1 = u1(q1)

        return q0, q1
```

### Main Circuit Definition
We then define the main quantum circuit using the `q` register for qubits and `c` for classical measurements.

```python
q = QuantumRegister(4)
c = ClassicalRegister(4)

# Apply X on q0 and q2
X(q[0])
X(q[2])

# Apply H on q0
H(q[0])

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q1
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply H on q1
H(q[1])

# Apply Cu1(pi/4) on q0 and q2
Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q1
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply H on q2
H(q[2])

# Apply Cu1(pi/8) on q0 and q3
Cu1Gate(pi/8, q[0], q[3]) q[0], q[3]

# Apply Cu1(pi/4) on q0 and q1
Cu1Gate(pi/4, q[0], q[1]) q[0], q[1]

# Apply Cu1(pi/2) on q0 and q2
Cu1Gate(pi/2, q[0], q[2]) q[0], q[2]

# Apply H on q3
H(q[3])

# Measure all qubits
c[0] = Measure(q[0])
c[1] = Measure(q[1])
c[2] = Measure(q[2])
c[3] = Measure(q[3])
```

### Full Cirq Code
Putting it all together, the final Cirq code is:

```python
from cirq import ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister, H, CNOT, U, Measure, CircuitOperation

class Cu1Gate(CircuitOperation):
    def __init__(self, theta, q0, q1):
        super().__init__(theta, [q0, q1])
        self.theta = theta
        self.q0 = q0
        self.q1 = q1

    def _circuit(self, q):
        theta = self.theta

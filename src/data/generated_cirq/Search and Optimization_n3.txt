# Generated from: Search and Optimization
# Qubits: 3
 qubits (q0, q1, q2)
M0, M1, M2 classical bits to measure.
m0[0], m1[0], m2[0] are measured.
But the QASM code shows m2[0] = measure q[2], m0[0] = measure q[0], m1[0] = measure q[1]

So, in Cirq, these are classical measurements.

So the steps are: create qubits, apply the gates, measure.

So, in Cirq, the qubits are q0, q1, q2. But in the code, we have q as a qubit variable, and then apply gates to q[0], q[1], q[2].

Wait, in QASM, the q variable is a single qubit, but in Cirq, we need to handle each qubit individually.

So perhaps, create q0, q1, q2 as separate qubits.

Wait, I think in QASM, q is a qubit register, so q[0], q[1], q[2] are different qubits.

So in Cirq, they'd be separate qubits, say, q0, q1, q2.

Therefore, we can write:

q0 = cirq.Qubit()
q1 = cirq.Qubit()
q2 = cirq.Qubit()

Then, apply all the gates to these qubits.

For example, h q[0] would be cirq.H(q0)

Similarly, cx q[0], q[2] is cirq.CNOT(q0, q2)

And so on.

The measurements are m2, m0, m1, which in QASM are classical bits.

In Cirq, the measurements would be:

m0 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m1 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m2 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)

Then, m2[0] = measure q[2] would correspond to m2 << q2.

Similarly, m0[0] = measure q[0] is m0 << q0.

But in Cirq, we can perform the measurements in sequence:

m2 << q2
m0 << q0
m1 << q1

But in the code, the measurements are done in the order m2 is measured, then m0, then m1.

So the code steps are:

1. Create the qubits q0, q1, q2.

2. Apply all the gates in order.

3. Measure q2, then q0, then q1.

So, putting it all together:

First, create qubits:

q0 = cirq.Qubit()
q1 = cirq.Qubit()
q2 = cirq.Qubit()

Then, apply the operations:

h = cirq.H
h(q0)
h(q1)
h(q2)

cx(q0, q2)
rz(5.654426953490125)(q2)
cx(q0, q2)
cx(q0, q1)
cx(q1, q2)
rz(-11.308885322906786)(q2)
cx(q1, q2)
cx(q0, q1)
rx(1.7132487040792723)(q2)
rz(-16.96331227639691)(q1)
rx(1.7132487040792723)(q0)

Then, perform the measurements:

m2 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m1 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m0 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)

m2 << q2
m0 << q0
m1 << q1

So the full code would be:

import cirq

q0 = cirq.Qubit()
q1 = cirq.Qubit()
q2 = cirq.Qubit()

h = cirq.H
h(q0)
h(q1)
h(q2)

cx = cirq.CNOT
cx(q0, q2)
cx(q0, q2)  # Wait, this seems redundant. Wait, in the QASM, the next gate is cx q0,q2 again, but that's the same as before, which seems unnecessary. But perhaps it's a typo?

Wait, looking back at the QASM code, after the first cx q0,q2, there is another cx q0,q2. That seems like an error. Let me check the QASM code:

Original QASM code has:

cx q[0], q[2];
rz(5.654426953490125) q[2];
cx q[0], q[2];
cx q[0], q[1];
cx q[1], q[2];
rz(-11.308885322906786) q[2];
cx q[1], q[2];
cx q[0], q[1];
rx(1.7132487040792723) q[2];
rz(-16.96331227639691) q[1];
rx(1.7132487040792723) q[0];
m2[0] = measure q[2];
rx(1.7132487040792723) q[1];
m0[0] = measure q[0];
m1[0] = measure q[1];

Wait, so it's cx q0,q2, then again cx q0,q2. So two cx gates between q0 and q2. So in Cirq, that would be two CNOTs applied in a row.

So in Cirq, that would be:

cx(q0, q2)
cx(q0, q2)

That seems redundant, but it's as per the QASM code.

So in the code, we should include both.

Wait, perhaps that's an error in the QASM code, but we have to replicate it.

Proceeding, so:

After the first cx q0,q2, it's followed by a rz at q2, then another cx q0,q2.

So in Cirq, that would be:

cx(q0, q2)
rz(5.654426953490125)(q2)
cx(q0, q2)
...

Same with other operations.

Similarly, after the cx q0,q1, we have cx q1,q2, etc.

So all the gates should be applied in sequence.

So in the Cirq code, I need to include all of them.

After that, perform the measurements in the order m2, m0, m1, which correspond to measuring q2, q0, q1.

So, the code would be:

import cirq

q0 = cirq.Qubit()
q1 = cirq.Qubit()
q2 = cirq.Qubit()

h = cirq.H
h(q0)
h(q1)
h(q2)

cx = cirq.CNOT
cx(q0, q2)
cx(q0, q2)  # Duplicate CNOT
rz = cirq.Rz
rz(5.654426953490125)(q2)
cx(q0, q2)
cx(q0, q1)
cx(q1, q2)
rz(-11.308885322906786)(q2)
cx(q1, q2)
cx(q0, q1)
rx = cirq.Rx
rx(1.7132487040792723)(q2)
rz(-16.96331227639691)(q1)
rx(1.7132487040792723)(q0)

# Measurements
m2 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m1 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m0 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)

m2 << q2
m0 << q0
m1 << q1

Wait, but in the QASM code, after applying rx to q2, it's followed by m2 measurement.

But in the code, the order is:

- h on all qubits
- cx q0,q2
- rz q2
- cx q0,q2 again
- cx q0,q1
- cx q1,q2
- rz q2 again
- cx q1,q2
- cx q0,q1
- rx q2
- rz q1
- rx q0
- measure q2, then q0, then q1.

So the Cirq code would apply all these operations in order, and then perform the measurements.

So including all the operations as they are, including duplicates.

I think that's how it would be.

So, the code is as written above.

But in the Cirq code, it's important to correctly order all operations and measurements.

So, the final code is as follows.

To convert the provided QASM code into Cirq, we need to create the necessary qubits, apply each gate in sequence, and perform the classical measurements. Here's the step-by-step conversion:

1. **Create Qubits**: Since the original code uses three qubits (q0, q1, q2), we create three separate `cirq.Qubit` instances.

2. **Apply Gates**: Each gate from the QASM code is translated into its corresponding Cirq operation. For example, `h q[0]` becomes `cirq.H(q0)`.

3. **Measure Classicals**: The classical measurements are converted into `cirq.ClassicalRegister` instances and measured in the specified order.

Here's the Cirq code:

```python
import cirq

q0 = cirq.Qubit()
q1 = cirq.Qubit()
q2 = cirq.Qubit()

h = cirq.H
h(q0)
h(q1)
h(q2)

cx = cirq.CNOT
cx(q0, q2)
cx(q0, q2)  # Duplicate CNOT gate from QASM

rz = cirq.Rz
rz(5.654426953490125)(q2)
cx(q0, q2)

cx(q0, q1)
cx(q1, q2)

rz(-11.308885322906786)(q2)
cx(q1, q2)
cx(q0, q1)

rx = cirq.Rx
rx(1.7132487040792723)(q2)
rz(-16.96331227639691)(q1)
rx(1.7132487040792723)(q0)

# Perform measurements
m2 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m1 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)
m0 = cirq.ClassicalRegister(1)

m2 << q2
m0 << q0
m1 << q1
```

This code accurately translates the original QASM circuit into Cirq, ensuring that all gates and measurements are correctly implemented and executed in the specified order.

# Qubits: 5
 qubits: q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.

So the Cirq code should have 5 qubits. Let me write the steps:

The original code applies H, T, H, H, H, H, H, H, etc. So need to map all operations to Cirq.

I think in the QASM code, the first qubit is q[0], the second is q[1], up to q[4]. So in Cirq, the qubits are q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.

So, let's write the operations step by step.

1. h q[2]: Apply H gate to q2.
2. t q[2]: Apply T gate to q2.
3. h q[2]: Apply H gate to q2.
4. h q[0]: Apply H gate to q0.
5. h q[1]: Apply H gate to q1.
6. h q[2]: Apply H gate to q2.
7. cx q[1], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q1 and q2.
8. cx q[0], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q0 and q2.
9. h q[0]: Apply H gate to q0.
10. h q[1]: Apply H gate to q1.
11. h q[3]: Apply H gate to q3.
12. cx q[3], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q3 and q2.
13. h q[2]: Apply H gate to q2.
14. h q[3]: Apply H gate to q3.
15. cx q[3], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q3 and q2.
16. cx q[0], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q0 and q2.
17. cx q[1], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q1 and q2.
18. cx q[3], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q3 and q2.
19. h q[2]: Apply H gate to q2.
20. h q[4]: Apply H gate to q4.
21. cx q[4], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q4 and q2.
22. h q[2]: Apply H gate to q2.
23. h q[4]: Apply H gate to q4.
24. cx q[4], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q4 and q2.
25. cx q[1], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q1 and q2.
26. cx q[3], q[2]: Apply CX gate between q3 and q2.
27. measure q[2] -> c[2] = measure q[2]
28. measure q[4] -> c[4] = measure q[4]
29. measure q[0] -> c[0] = measure q[0]
30. measure q[1] -> c[1] = measure q[1]
31. measure q[3] -> c[3] = measure q[3]

Wait, but in QASM, the first qubit is typically the leftmost. However, in Cirq, the qubits are ordered such that q0 is the first in the list. So if in the QASM code, the operations are q[0], q[1], etc., then in Cirq, q0 is the first qubit, q1 is the second, etc.

So for example, when the QASM code does "h q[2]", in Cirq it would correspond to applying H to the third qubit in the list, which is q2.

So now, let's write the Cirq code.

We need to create 5 qubits: q0, q1, q2, q3, q4. So the code would be:

from cirq import CirqProgram
from cirq import H, T, CX, Measure, F

program = CirqProgram()

q = program.qubits()

# Initialize all qubits to the state |0⟩
# but wait, actually in the code, the initial state isn't specified. So we need to create them.

But in QASM, the qubits are initialized to |0> by default, right? So in Cirq, we can create the qubits without any initial state. So just define them.

But let me think. The way Cirq works, you create a list of qubits, and each is initialized to |0⟩.

So:

q0, q1, q2, q3, q4 = q

Then, the operations are as per the steps above.

Let me write them in order.

1. H(q2): H(q2)
2. T(q2): T(q2)
3. H(q2): H(q2)
4. H(q0): H(q0)
5. H(q1): H(q1)
6. H(q2): H(q2)
7. CX(q1, q2)
8. CX(q0, q2)
9. H(q0)
10. H(q1)
11. H(q3)
12. CX(q3, q2)
13. H(q2)
14. H(q3)
15. CX(q3, q2)
16. CX(q0, q2)
17. CX(q1, q2)
18. CX(q3, q2)
19. H(q2)
20. H(q4)
21. CX(q4, q2)
22. H(q2)
23. H(q4)
24. CX(q4, q2)
25. CX(q1, q2)
26. CX(q3, q2)
Then, measurements.

measurements = [
    Measure(q2, classical_register('c2')),  # c[2] = measure q2
    Measure(q4, classical_register('c4')),  # c[4] = measure q4
    Measure(q0, classical_register('c0')),  # c[0] = measure q0
    Measure(q1, classical_register('c1')),  # c[1] = measure q1
    Measure(q3, classical_register('c3')),  # c[3] = measure q3
]

Wait, but in Cirq, the measurements are done in the classical register. So in Cirq, you can just write the measure operations with the qubits and the classical registers.

But I think in Cirq, the standard way is to call the Measure gate. Each Measure is a separate operation. So in the code, each measure is a separate operation.

So the full code would be:

from cirq import CirqProgram, H, T, CX, Measure, F

program = CirqProgram()
q0, q1, q2, q3, q4 = program.create_qubits(5)

# Step 1: H(q2)
program.append(H(q2))

# Step 2: T(q2)
program.append(T(q2))

# Step 3: H(q2)
program.append(H(q2))

# Step 4: H(q0)
program.append(H(q0))

# Step 5: H(q1)
program.append(H(q1))

# Step 6: H(q2)
program.append(H(q2))

# Step 7: CX(q1, q2)
program.append(CX(q1, q2))

# Step 8: CX(q0, q2)
program.append(CX(q0, q2))

# Step 9: H(q0)
program.append(H(q0))

# Step 10: H(q1)
program.append(H(q1))

# Step 11: H(q3)
program.append(H(q3))

# Step 12: CX(q3, q2)
program.append(CX(q3, q2))

# Step 13: H(q2)
program.append(H(q2))

# Step 14: H(q3)
program.append(H(q3))

# Step 15: CX(q3, q2)
program.append(CX(q3, q2))

# Step 16: CX(q0, q2)
program.append(CX(q0, q2))

# Step 17: CX(q1, q2)
program.append(CX(q1, q2))

# Step 18: CX(q3, q2)
program.append(CX(q3, q2))

# Step 19: H(q2)
program.append(H(q2))

# Step 20: H(q4)
program.append(H(q4))

# Step 21: CX(q4, q2)
program.append(CX(q4, q2))

# Step 22: H(q2)
program.append(H(q2))

# Step 23: H(q4)
program.append(H(q4))

# Step 24: CX(q4, q2)
program.append(CX(q4, q2))

# Step 25: CX(q1, q2)
program.append(CX(q1, q2))

# Step 26: CX(q3, q2)
program.append(CX(q3, q2))

# Measure q2
program.append(Measure(q2, classical_register('c2')))
# Measure q4
program.append(Measure(q4, classical_register('c4')))
# Measure q0
program.append(Measure(q0, classical_register('c0')))
# Measure q1
program.append(Measure(q1, classical_register('c1')))
# Measure q3
program.append(Measure(q3, classical_register('c3')))

print(program)

Wait, but in Cirq, each Measure is a separate operation, and the classical registers are named as 'c2', 'c4', etc. So the code should be correct.

Wait, but I think that in Cirq, the order of operations matters, so perhaps I should write the code in the exact order as per the steps.

Yes, that's what I did.

But let me check if the initial code includes the correct gates.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the ordering. Let me verify the steps:

Looking back at the QASM code:

The steps are:

1. h q[2] → H(q2)
2. t q[2] → T(q2)
3. h q[2] → H(q2)
4. h q[0] → H(q0)
5. h q[1] → H(q1)
6. h q[2] → H(q2)
7. cx q[1], q[2] → CX(q1, q2)
8. cx q[0], q[2] → CX(q0, q2)
9. h q[0] → H(q0)
10. h q[1] → H(q1)
11. h q[3] → H(q3)
12. cx q[3], q[2] → CX(q3, q2)
13. h q[2] → H(q2)
14. h q[3] → H(q3)
15. cx q[3], q[2] → CX(q3, q2)
16. cx q[0], q[2] → CX(q0, q2)
17. cx q[1], q[2] → CX(q1, q2)
18. cx q[3], q[2] → CX(q3, q2)
19. h q[2] → H(q2)
20. h q[4] → H(q4)
21. cx q[4], q[2] → CX(q4, q2)
22. h q[2] → H(q2)
23. h q[4] → H(q4)
24. cx q[4], q[2] → CX(q4, q2)
25. cx q[1], q[2] → CX(q1, q2)
26. cx q[3], q[2] → CX(q3, q2)
Then measurements.

So the Cirq code steps 1 to 26 are correct, then the measurements steps 27 to 31.

Wait, but in Cirq, after all the operations, you have to perform the measurements. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the ordering of the CX gates. For example, in step 12: CX(q3, q2). That's a controlled X on q3 controlling q2. So in Cirq, that's CX(q3, q2). Correct.

Similarly, step 15 is CX(q3, q2). Correct.

Step 16 is CX(q0, q2). Correct.

And so on.

I think this should be the correct Cirq code. Let me write it again.

But wait, in Cirq, the gates are applied in the order they are appended. So I need to make sure that the operations are in the same order as the original QASM code.

Yes, that's what I did.

So the final Cirq code should be:

from cirq import CirqProgram, H, T, CX, Measure

program = CirqProgram()
q0, q1, q2, q3, q4 = program.create_qubits(5)

# Operations
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(T(q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q0))
program.append(H(q1))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(CX(q1, q2))
program.append(CX(q0, q2))
program.append(H(q0))
program.append(H(q1))
program.append(H(q3))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q3))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))
program.append(CX(q0, q2))
program.append(CX(q1, q2))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q4))
program.append(CX(q4, q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q4))
program.append(CX(q4, q2))
program.append(CX(q1, q2))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))

# Measurements
program.append(Measure(q2, classical_register('c2')))
program.append(Measure(q4, classical_register('c4')))
program.append(Measure(q0, classical_register('c0')))
program.append(Measure(q1, classical_register('c1')))
program.append(Measure(q3, classical_register('c3')))

print(program)

Wait, but in the QASM code, the first qubit is q[0], which corresponds to q0 in Cirq, so the order is correct.

I think this should work. Let me make sure that all the operations are correctly included.

Yes, each step from the QASM code is converted into the corresponding Cirq gate application. Then the measurements are performed on each qubit.

So, the Cirq code should correctly implement the quantum repetition code encoder as described.
</think>

To convert the provided QASM code into Cirq code, we need to map each quantum operation and measurement to the corresponding Cirq gates and operations. The resulting Cirq code should correctly simulate the quantum repetition code encoder.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Qubits**: The QASM code uses qubits `q[0]` to `q[4]`, which correspond to `q0` to `q4` in Cirq.

2. **Map Gates**:
   - `H`: Apply the Hadamard gate.
   - `T`: Apply the T gate (square root of NOT).
   - `CX`: Apply the CNOT gate.

3. **Order of Operations**: Ensure each operation from the QASM code is translated into the correct Cirq operation in the same sequence.

4. **Measurements**: Translate each measurement into a `Measure` gate in Cirq, using the appropriate classical register.

### Cirq Code:

```python
from cirq import CirqProgram, H, T, CX, Measure, classical_register

program = CirqProgram()
q0, q1, q2, q3, q4 = program.create_qubits(5)

# Define the operations in the order of the QASM code
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(T(q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q0))
program.append(H(q1))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(CX(q1, q2))
program.append(CX(q0, q2))
program.append(H(q0))
program.append(H(q1))
program.append(H(q3))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q3))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))
program.append(CX(q0, q2))
program.append(CX(q1, q2))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q4))
program.append(CX(q4, q2))
program.append(H(q2))
program.append(H(q4))
program.append(CX(q4, q2))
program.append(CX(q1, q2))
program.append(CX(q3, q2))

# Perform measurements
program.append(Measure(q2, classical_register('c2')))
program.append(Measure(q4, classical_register('c4')))
program.append(Measure(q0, classical_register('c0')))
program.append(Measure(q1, classical_register('c1')))
program.append(Measure(q3, classical_register('c3')))

print(program)
```

### Explanation:

- **Qubits Initialization**: The code initializes five qubits (`q0` to `q4`).
- **Operations**: Each QASM gate (`H`, `T`, `CX`) is converted to the corresponding Cirq gate and applied in the same order.
- **Measurements**: Each measurement in QASM is translated to a `Measure` gate in Cirq, using the specified classical register names.

This Cirq code correctly simulates the quantum repetition code encoder, ensuring all operations are applied in the correct sequence and measurements are accurately performed.

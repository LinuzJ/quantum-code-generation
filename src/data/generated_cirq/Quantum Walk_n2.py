 qubits.

Circuit:

1. Start with two qubits in state |00⟩.
2. Apply a controlled-U(π/2, π) gate to both qubits.
3. Apply a controlled-U(π/4, 0, π) gate to both qubits.
4. Apply a controlled-U(π, pi, pi) gate to both qubits.
5. Apply a controlled-U(π/2, pi/2, pi) gate to both qubits.
6. Apply a controlled-U(π/4, pi/2, pi) gate to both qubits.
7. Apply a controlled-U(pi, pi, pi) gate to both qubits.
8. Measure both qubits.

Wait, no, the description says the quantum walks on graphs with up to 4 nodes, but the code seems to be using two qubits only. Hmm, perhaps that's a mistake, but the user says it's two qubits.

Looking back at the code, I can see that q1 is a 2-qubit qubit, and c1 is a classical bit. So the circuit indeed is two qubits.

So the steps:

1. Start with |00⟩.

2. Apply a controlled-U(π/2, π) to both qubits.

Wait, in QASM, the u3 gate is a 3-term unitary, which can be represented in Cirq as a custom gate or using cirq.CNOT and other rotations.

But in Cirq, using the cirq.operators.CircuitModule, perhaps.

But wait, the user says to include the code that can be directly output, making sure it's syntactically correct.

In QASM, each u3 gate is a multi-qubit gate.

Looking at the code, the gates applied are:

1. u3(1.5705854245991118, -3.1667235621803993, -1.58730875641222e-05) q1[0];

This is a three-term rotation for qubit q1[0]. The three angles correspond to the rotation angles around the x, y, and z axes respectively.

In Cirq, the u3 gate can be represented as a combination of cnot, cphase, and other rotations. However, since Cirq doesn't natively support multi-qubit u3 gates, perhaps we can represent them using custom gates or combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, and the gates are controlled-U operations where both qubits are involved.

Wait, looking at the code, the gates are:

cx q1[0], q1[1];
u3(...) q1[0];
u3(...) q1[1];
cx q1[0], q1[1];
u3(...) q1[0];
u3(...) q1[1];
cx q1[0], q1[1];
u3(...) q1[0];
u3(...) q1[1];
cx q1[0], q1[1];
u3(...) q1[0];
u3(...) q1[1];
c1[0] = measure q1[0];
c1[1] = measure q1[1];

So each u3 gate is applied to a single qubit, but the cx gates are between the two qubits, so controlled by both.

Wait, no, in QASM, a cx gate is a two-qubit gate: it's a CNOT gate.

But in the code, the u3 gates are single-qubit, but are they being controlled in any way? Wait, no. It seems that the u3 gates are only applied to q1[0] and q1[1], but without any controls. So in the code, each u3 is a single-qubit rotation applied to each qubit, without any control. So the operations are:

1. Apply a u3 gate to q1[0].

2. Apply a u3 gate to q1[1].

3. Apply a CNOT (cx) between q1[0] and q1[1].

4. Apply a u3 gate to q1[0].

5. Apply a u3 gate to q1[1].

6. Apply a cx between q1[0] and q1[1].

7. Apply a u3 gate to q1[0].

8. Apply a u3 gate to q1[1].

9. Measure both qubits.

Wait, that seems a bit more involved. So each u3 is a rotation on a single qubit, but without any control.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me look again.

In the code:

- The first gate is u3(1.5705854245991118, -3.1667235621803993, -1.58730875641222e-05) q1[0];

So that's a u3 gate applied to q1[0] with angles (x, y, z) as given.

Similarly for q1[1].

So each u3 is a single-qubit operation, not controlled by any other qubit.

Then, the next gate is cx q1[0], q1[1], so that's a CNOT gate where q1[0] is the control, q1[1] is the target.

Then another u3 on q1[0], etc.

So, the sequence is:

1. Start with |00⟩.

2. Apply u3(1.57..., -3.166..., -1.587e-05) to q1[0].

3. Apply u3(0.786..., 1.499..., 0.05022) to q1[1].

4. Apply CNOT: q1[0] controls q1[1].

5. Apply u3 to q1[0] with (0.0502248..., 0, pi).

6. Apply u3 to q1[1] with (1.64184..., -pi/2, pi).

7. Apply CNOT again.

8. Apply u3 to q1[0] with (1.4956e-05, pi/2, pi).

9. Apply u3 to q1[1] with (pi/2, pi/2, pi).

10. Apply CNOT again.

11. Apply u3 to q1[0] with (1.5705854245991133, -3.1416..., -0.02513).

12. Apply u3 to q1[1] with (2.3547..., 3.0913..., -0.07102).

13. Measure both qubits.

So in terms of Cirq code, each of these operations needs to be translated.

In Cirq, u3 gates are not natively supported, so we can represent them using the built-in operations.

The u3 gate is equivalent to a combination of rotations around x, y, and z axes. So, in Cirq, it can be represented by applying cnot, cphase, and other rotations as needed.

Wait, but since in the code, the u3 gates are applied to individual qubits, not controlled by anything else, we can represent each u3 gate as a single-qubit rotation.

In Cirq, the rotation around x, y, and z can be represented using cirq.Rx, cirq.Ry, cirq.Rz, and then combined using cirq.Circuit.

But since each u3 gate is a three-term rotation, perhaps the simplest way is to apply a rotation matrix as a custom gate or using built-in operations.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be translated into a series of cnot, ry, rz, etc., operations.

But this might get complicated. Let me think.

Each u3 gate is a single-qubit operation. So, for each qubit, we can represent the rotation matrix as:

U = exp(-i * (theta_x * X + theta_y * Y + theta_z * Z))

where X, Y, Z are Pauli matrices.

So in code, this can be achieved by applying cphase gates and cnots.

For example, a rotation around x by theta is cphase(-theta) followed by cnot (which applies X). Similarly for y and z.

Wait, actually, the cphase gate (circuit.CPhase) applies a phase shift of e^{-i theta} based on the Pauli Z. So to create a rotation around x, you can do cphase(theta) followed by X (cnot). Similarly for y and z.

So for a u3 gate, we can break it down into three steps:

1. Apply a cphase(theta_x) to qubit q.

2. Apply a cnot (X gate) to qubit q.

3. Apply a cphase(theta_z) to qubit q.

Wait, no, the order matters. Wait, the rotation is U = X(θ_x) Y(θ_y) Z(θ_z). But the order of applying the rotations is important.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

Apply Z(θ_z), then Y(θ_y), then X(θ_x). Because rotation matrices are applied from right to left.

Wait, the rotation around x, y, z can be a bit confusing. Let me recall: the rotation operator for an axis can be expressed as a product of rotations. For example, a rotation around x by theta is equivalent to applying a rotation around z by theta/2, then around y by theta, then around z by theta/2.

But perhaps the easiest way is to represent each u3 gate as a combination of cphase and cnot operations.

In any case, perhaps it's easier to represent each u3 gate as a custom gate in Cirq. However, in modern Cirq, the best way is to use the built-in functions.

Wait, another approach is to use the built-in cirq.Circuit and apply the necessary operations.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken and the u3 gates are controlled-U gates. But looking at the code, the u3 gates are applied to q1[0] and q1[1] without any control, so they are single-qubit operations.

So, for each u3 gate, we can represent it as a single-qubit rotation.

In Cirq, the code would start with two qubits:

q = cirq.Qubit(2)

Then, the initial state is |00⟩, which can be represented as:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

Then, for each operation in the QASM code, we need to apply the corresponding Cirq gate.

So let's go step by step.

1. u3(1.5705854245991118, -3.1667235621803993, -1.58730875641222e-05) q1[0];

This is a single-qubit u3 gate on q1[0]. Let's compute the angles:

theta_x ≈ 1.5705854 radians ≈ π/2

theta_y ≈ -3.16672356 radians ≈ -π

theta_z ≈ -1.5873e-05 radians ≈ -0.000187

So this is a rotation around x by π/2, around y by -π, around z by almost 0.

But the order matters. So the rotation matrix would be:

U = X(θ_x) Y(θ_y) Z(θ_z)

But when applying gates, the order is important. Since the rotation is U = Z(θ_z) Y(θ_y) X(θ_x), because rotations are applied from the right.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is Z(theta_z) Y(theta_y) X(theta_x). Let me verify:

The general rotation matrix around arbitrary axis can be expressed as:

R(θ_x, θ_y, θ_z) = Z(θ_z) Y(θ_y) X(θ_x)

So yes, the order is Z, Y, X.

So to apply this rotation, we can do:

- Apply Z(theta_z): cphase(theta_z)
- Apply Y(theta_y): cnot and cphase(theta_y)
- Apply X(theta_x): cnot

But wait, actually, Y(theta) is implemented as cphase(theta) followed by a cnot, but I think the order is: to get Y(theta), you apply cphase(theta) followed by X (which is cnot). Similarly, Z(theta) is just cphase(theta).

So for the u3 gate, the steps would be:

1. Apply Z(theta_z) to q: cphase(theta_z)
2. Apply Y(theta_y) to q: cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot
3. Apply X(theta_x) to q: cnot

But wait, the X(theta_x) is a rotation around x, which is just a cnot. Wait, no, cnot is X(π), which is a π rotation. So to get a rotation around x by theta_x, which is less than π, you need to use cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct that. Let's see:

- Rotation around X by θ is X(θ) = cphase(θ) followed by X (cnot). So, the order is cphase(θ), then cnot.

Similarly for Y and Z.

So for the u3 gate:

U = Z(theta_z) Y(theta_y) X(theta_x)

Which translates to:

1. Apply cphase(theta_z) on q.
2. Apply cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot on q.
3. Apply cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot on q.

Wait, but the X(theta_x) is a rotation by theta_x, which is achieved by cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot. Similarly for Y.

So the sequence is:

cphase(theta_z) → cnot → cphase(theta_y) → cnot → cphase(theta_x) → cnot.

Wait, no, because the rotation is Z Y X, so the order is Z first, then Y, then X.

Each gate is applied as follows:

- Apply Z(theta_z): cphase(theta_z)
- Apply Y(theta_y): cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot
- Apply X(theta_x): cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot

So the overall sequence is:

1. cphase(theta_z)
2. cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot
3. cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot

Wait, but this seems off because the order is Z, Y, X, so the operations should be applied in the order Z, Y, X, each as per their own steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

Apply X(theta_x) first, then Y(theta_y), then Z(theta_z). Because when you apply gates, the rightmost gate is applied first.

Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the rotation is applied as R = Z Y X, meaning that you first apply X, then Y, then Z.

But when applying gates, the order is from left to right, so the first gate applied is Z, then Y, then X.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The rotation matrix is R = Z Y X. So to apply this, you first apply X, then Y, then Z. Because matrix multiplication is done from the right.

So in terms of gate application, the order is:

1. Apply X(theta_x): cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot.
2. Apply Y(theta_y): cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot.
3. Apply Z(theta_z): cphase(theta_z).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you have R = Z Y X, the order is Z applied first, then Y, then X.

But in terms of gate application, the first gate is the rightmost one.

So to get the correct composition, you need to apply X first, then Y, then Z.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to apply the gates in the reverse order of the matrix multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the rotation is applied as:

R = Z(theta_z) * Y(theta_y) * X(theta_x)

So when applying to a state |ψ⟩, it's R|ψ⟩ = Z(theta_z) Y(theta_y) X(theta_x) |ψ⟩.

Which can be written as X(theta_x) Y(theta_y) Z(theta_z) applied to |ψ⟩? Wait, no, matrix multiplication order is opposite to gate application.

So in terms of gate application, the order is:

First apply Z(theta_z), then Y(theta_y), then X(theta_x).

Because when you multiply matrices, the rightmost is applied first.

So to represent R = Z Y X, you first apply Z, then Y, then X.

But in terms of gate application, each gate is applied one after another, so the order is Z, then Y, then X.

So for each u3 gate, the steps are:

1. Apply cphase(theta_z) to q.

2. Apply cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot to q.

3. Apply cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot to q.

Wait, but theta_x is the angle for X, which is a rotation around X, so to apply X(theta_x), you do cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot.

Similarly, Y(theta_y) is cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot.

Z(theta_z) is just cphase(theta_z).

So the sequence is:

cphase(theta_z) → cnot → cphase(theta_y) → cnot → cphase(theta_x) → cnot.

Wait, no, because the gates are applied in the order Z, Y, X. So the first gate applied is Z, which is cphase(theta_z). Then Y, which is cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot. Then X, which is cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot.

So the order is:

1. cphase(theta_z)

2. cphase(theta_y) + cnot

3. cphase(theta_x) + cnot

But since each gate is applied one after another, the overall code would be:

circuit = Circuit()

# Apply u3 to q0
theta_x = 1.5705854245991118
theta_y = -3.1667235621803993
theta_z = -1.58730875641222e-05

# Apply Z(theta_z)
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q))
# Apply Y(theta_y) = cphase(theta_y) + cnot
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q, q))
# Apply X(theta_x) = cphase(theta_x) + cnot
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q, q))

But wait, this is for a single qubit. In our case, the u3 is applied to q1[0], which is the first qubit.

So, in the Cirq code, each u3 gate on q1[0] is a single-qubit operation, so the above code would be correct for that.

But wait, in the QASM code, after applying the u3 gate, the next gate is a cx (CNOT) between q1[0] and q1[1].

So for each such cx, we need to apply a cnot from q1[0] to q1[1].

So, the code steps would be:

For each u3 on q1[0], apply the three gates as above.

Similarly for each u3 on q1[1], apply the three gates.

Then, for each cx, apply cnot(q0, q1).

So, let's try to translate the entire code.

The QASM code has:

1. u3 q1[0]: apply the three gates.

2. u3 q1[1]: apply the three gates.

3. cx q1[0], q1[1]: apply cnot(q0, q1).

4. u3 q1[0]: same as step 1.

5. u3 q1[1]: same as step 2.

6. cx q1[0], q1[1]: apply cnot.

7. u3 q1[0]: same as step 1.

8. u3 q1[1]: same as step 2.

9. cx q1[0], q1[1]: apply cnot.

10. u3 q1[0]: same as step 1.

11. u3 q1[1]: same as step 2.

12. cx q1[0], q1[1]: apply cnot.

13. Measure both qubits.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me see:

Looking at the QASM code, after the initial u3 on q1[0] and q1[1], comes a cx, then u3 on q1[0], etc.

Wait, no, in the code, after the first two u3s, comes a cx, then u3s on each qubit, then cx, etc.

So the sequence is:

After the initial |00⟩, the gates are applied in the order:

u3(q1[0]) → u3(q1[1]) → cx(q0, q1) → u3(q1[0]) → u3(q1[1]) → cx → u3(q1[0]) → u3(q1[1]) → cx → u3(q1[0]) → u3(q1[1]) → cx.

Wait, no, looking at the code:

After the initial two u3s on q1[0] and q1[1], the next is cx.

Then u3 on q1[0], u3 on q1[1], cx, u3 on q1[0], u3 on q1[1], cx, u3 on q1[0], u3 on q1[1], cx.

So the code has:

gates = [
    u3(q1[0]),
    u3(q1[1]),
    cx(q0, q1),
    u3(q1[0]),
    u3(q1[1]),
    cx(q0, q1),
    u3(q1[0]),
    u3(q1[1]),
    cx(q0, q1),
    u3(q1[0]),
    u3(q1[1]),
    cx(q0, q1),
    u3(q1[0]),
    u3(q1[1]),
]

So in the Cirq code, we need to represent all these steps.

This is getting quite involved, but let's proceed.

In Cirq, the code would start with two qubits.

q0 = cirq.Qubit(0)
q1 = cirq.Qubit(1)
circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

Then, for each of the 14 gates, apply the corresponding operation.

First, the u3 on q0:

theta_x = 1.5705854245991118  # π/2
theta_y = -3.1667235621803993 # -π
theta_z = -1.58730875641222e-05 # ~0

So for q0's u3:

circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))

Wait, no, the order is Z(theta_z), then Y(theta_y) = cphase(theta_y) + X (cnot), then X(theta_x) = cphase(theta_x) + X (cnot). So the order is:

cphase(theta_z) → cphase(theta_y) → cnot → cphase(theta_x) → cnot.

Wait, no, because the rotation is Z Y X, so the order is:

1. Apply Z(theta_z): cphase(theta_z)
2. Apply Y(theta_y): cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot
3. Apply X(theta_x): cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot.

So the order is:

cphase(theta_z) → cphase(theta_y) → cnot → cphase(theta_x) → cnot.

But in the code, each gate is applied in the order they are written.

So the code for the first u3 on q0 would be:

circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))

Wait, no, because the rotation is Z Y X, so the order is:

Apply Z, then Y, then X. Each Y and X are applied as cphase + cnot.

So:

1. Apply Z(theta_z): cphase(theta_z)
2. Apply Y(theta_y): cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot
3. Apply X(theta_x): cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot.

So the code would be:

circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q0))
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))

Wait, but this seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a more efficient way to represent this.

Alternatively, perhaps using the cirq.SingleQubit gate with the rotation matrix directly. But Cirq doesn't have a built-in u3 gate, so perhaps we can create a custom gate.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the u3 gate as a combination of cnot, ry, rz, and phase shifts.

Wait, another approach: in Cirq, you can represent the u3 gate as a custom two-qubit gate, but in our case, each u3 is applied to a single qubit, so perhaps it's better to represent it as a single-qubit rotation.

But to do that, we need to represent the rotation matrix as a combination of cphase and cnot.

So, for each u3 gate, the code would be:

cphase(theta_z)
cphase(theta_y)
cnot
cphase(theta_x)
cnot

But wait, the order is Z, Y, X. So the code is:

cphase(theta_z) → cphase(theta_y) → cnot → cphase(theta_x) → cnot.

Yes.

So, in code, for each u3 on a qubit, we apply these five steps.

Similarly, for the u3 on q1[1], we do the same.

Then, for each cx, apply cnot(q0, q1).

So, putting it all together, the Cirq code would have a loop that applies these steps.

But writing this manually for each gate might be tedious, but since the user wants the code part, perhaps it's manageable.

So, let's structure the code.

First, initialize the circuit:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

Then, for each of the u3 on q0 and q1, apply the five gates as above.

But looking at the QASM code, after the first two u3s on q0 and q1, we have a cx, then u3s again on q0 and q1, etc.

So the full sequence is:

1. u3(q0): apply Z, Y, X as above.

2. u3(q1): same.

3. cx(q0, q1): apply cnot.

4. u3(q0): same.

5. u3(q1): same.

6. cx(q0, q1): apply cnot.

7. u3(q0): same.

8. u3(q1): same.

9. cx(q0, q1): apply cnot.

10. u3(q0): same.

11. u3(q1): same.

12. cx(q0, q1): apply cnot.

13. Measure both qubits.

So the code needs to reflect this.

But in the Cirq code, each gate is added in the order they appear, so the code would be quite long.

But let's try to write it out.

First, for the initial state:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

Then, define the angles for each u3 gate.

u3_theta_x = [

]

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each theta_x, theta_y, theta_z for each u3 gate.

But in the QASM code, each u3 gate has specific angles. Let's list all of them.

Looking at the QASM code:

1. u3(1.5705854245991118, -3.1667235621803993, -1.58730875641222e-05) q1[0];

2. u3(0.7864502280785407, 1.4997452219669574, 0.050219564359156976) q1[1];

3. u3(0.050224804187928476, 0, pi) q1[0];

4. u3(1.6418473665068425, -pi/2, pi) q1[1];

5. u3(1.4956790561350626e-05, pi/2, pi) q1[0];

6. u3(pi/2, pi/2, pi) q1[1];

7. u3(1.5705854245991133, -3.1416085266773286, -0.02513090859065059) q1[0];

8. u3(2.3547213646862812, 3.091394193838764, -0.07102121943155337) q1[1];

So we have eight u3 gates:

For q0:

1. theta_x = 1.5705854245991118 ≈ π/2
   theta_y = -3.1667235621803993 ≈ -π
   theta_z = -1.58730875641222e-05 ≈ -0.000187

5. theta_x = 1.4956790561350626e-05 ≈ 0.000149
   theta_y = pi/2 ≈ 1.5708
   theta_z = pi ≈ 3.1416

7. theta_x = 1.5705854245991133 ≈ π/2
   theta_y = -3.1416085266773286 ≈ -π
   theta_z = -0.02513090859065059 ≈ -0.025

For q1:

2. theta_x = 0.7864502280785407 ≈ π/4 (since π/4 ≈ 0.7854)
   theta_y = 1.4997452219669574 ≈ ~1.5 radians (which is less than π/2? Wait, π/2 is ~1.5708. So 1.5 is just less than π/2. Hmm, perhaps it's just a value.

But wait, in QASM, the angles are in radians.

Similarly:

4. theta_x = 1.6418473665068425
   theta_y = -pi/2
   theta_z = pi

6. theta_x = pi/2
   theta_y = pi/2
   theta_z = pi

8. theta_x = 2.3547213646862812 ≈ 3π/4 (since π≈3.1416, 3π/4≈2.356)
   theta_y = 3.091394193838764 ≈ ~3.091 radians (which is ~177 degrees, close to π)
   theta_z = -0.07102121943155337 ≈ -0.071

So for each of the eight u3 gates, we have specific theta_x, theta_y, theta_z.

So the code will have to apply each of these in order.

This is getting very lengthy, but let's proceed.

The code structure would be:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

# q0 u3 gates
for i in range(3):
    # gate 1, 5, 7
    if i == 0:
        theta_x = 1.5705854245991118
        theta_y = -3.1667235621803993
        theta_z = -1.58730875641222e-05
    elif i == 1:
        theta_x = 1.4956790561350626e-05
        theta_y = cirq.pi/2  # or math.pi/2
        theta_z = cirq.pi
    elif i == 2:
        theta_x = 1.5705854245991133
        theta_y = -3.1416085266773286
        theta_z = -0.02513090859065059
    # apply cphase(theta_z)
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q0))
    # apply cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q0))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))
    # apply cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q0))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q0))

# q1 u3 gates
for i in range(4):
    if i == 0:
        theta_x = 0.7864502280785407
        theta_y = 1.4997452219669574
        theta_z = 0.050219564359156976
    elif i == 1:
        theta_x = 1.6418473665068425
        theta_y = -cirq.pi/2
        theta_z = cirq.pi
    elif i == 2:
        theta_x = cirq.pi/2
        theta_y = cirq.pi/2
        theta_z = cirq.pi
    elif i == 3:
        theta_x = 2.3547213646862812
        theta_y = 3.091394193838764
        theta_z = -0.07102121943155337
    # apply cphase(theta_z)
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q1))
    # apply cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))
    # apply cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

Wait, no. Wait, for q1, each u3 gate is applied, so for each of the four u3 gates on q1, we need to apply the same five steps: cphase(theta_z), cphase(theta_y) + cnot, cphase(theta_x) + cnot.

So in code:

for each of the four u3 gates on q1:
    apply cphase(theta_z) to q1
    apply cphase(theta_y) followed by cnot on q1
    apply cphase(theta_x) followed by cnot on q1

Similarly, for the u3 gates on q0.

But in the code, after the first two u3 gates, the next gate is a cx (cnot) between q0 and q1.

So after the initial two u3 gates on q0 and q1, we have a cnot(q0, q1).

Then, the next u3 on q0, then u3 on q1, then cnot, etc.

So in the code, after the first two u3s on q0 and q1, we need to add a cnot.

Then, for each subsequent u3 on q0 and q1, followed by a cnot.

Wait, but in the QASM code, the gates are:

After the first two u3s on q0 and q1, we have a cx.

Then u3 on q0, u3 on q1, cx.

Then u3 on q0, u3 on q1, cx.

Then u3 on q0, u3 on q1, cx.

Then u3 on q0, u3 on q1, cx.

Then measure.

So in code, after each pair of u3s on q0 and q1, we have a cnot.

So the code should have, after each u3 on q0 and q1, a cnot(q0, q1).

But in the QASM code, the order is:

u3(q0) → u3(q1) → cx → u3(q0) → u3(q1) → cx → u3(q0) → u3(q1) → cx → u3(q0) → u3(q1) → cx.

So the code would have 4 cnots after the u3s.

Thus, in the Cirq code, after each pair of u3s on q0 and q1, add a cnot(q0, q1).

So the code would look like:

# initial state
circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

# process q0 u3 gates and cnots
for i in range(3):
    # apply u3 on q0
    if i == 0:
        theta_x = 1.5705854245991118
        theta_y = -3.1667235621803993
        theta_z = -1.58730875641222e-05
    elif i == 1:
        theta_x = 1.4956790561350626e-05
        theta_y = cirq.pi/2
        theta_z = cirq.pi
    elif i == 2:
        theta_x = 1.5705854245991133
        theta_y = -3.1416085266773286
        theta_z = -0.02513090859065059
    # apply u3 on q0
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q0))
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q0))

    # apply cnot after u3 on q1
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

# process q1 u3 gates and cnots
for i in range(4):
    # apply u3 on q1
    if i == 0:
        theta_x = 0.7864502280785407
        theta_y = 1.4997452219669574
        theta_z = 0.050219564359156976
    elif i == 1:

    elif i == 2:
        theta_x = cirq.pi/2

        theta_z = cirq.pi
    elif i == 3:
        theta_x = 2.3547213646862812
        theta_y = 3.091394193838764
        theta_z = -0.07102121943155337
    # apply u3 on q1
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))
    # apply cnot after next u3 on q0
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

Wait, no. Because after each pair of u3s on q0 and q1, we have a cnot. So in the QASM code, the cnot comes after the u3 on q1, before the next u3 on q0.

So in the Cirq code, after the u3 on q1 is applied, we add the cnot.

Thus, the code should have, after each u3 on q1, a cnot.

So the code would be:

# initial state
circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

# process q0 u3 gates and cnots

    # apply u3 on q0

    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))
    # apply cnot after u3 on q0
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

Wait, but in the QASM code, after the first two u3s on q0 and q1, we have a cnot, then u3s again, etc. So in the code above, after each u3 on q0, we add a cnot, which is not correct. Because in the QASM code, the cnot comes after the u3 on q1.

So the code should have, after each u3 on q1, a cnot.

Thus, the code should be structured so that after applying a u3 on q1, we add a cnot.

Thus, in the q1 u3 loop, after applying the u3 on q1, add the cnot.

So the code would be:

for each of the four u3 on q1:
    apply u3 on q1
    apply cnot(q0, q1)

But in the QASM code, the cnot comes after the u3 on q1, before the next u3 on q0.

Thus, in the Cirq code, after applying the u3 on q1, add the cnot.

So the code would be:

# process q1 u3 gates and cnots
for i in range(4):
    # apply u3 on q1
    if i == 0:
        theta_x = 0.7864502280785407
        theta_y = 1.4997452219669574
        theta_z = 0.050219564359156976
    elif i == 1:
        theta_x = 1.6418473665068425
        theta_y = -cirq.pi/2
        theta_z = cirq.pi
    elif i == 2:
        theta_x = cirq.pi/2
        theta_y = cirq.pi/2
        theta_z = cirq.pi
    elif i == 3:
        theta_x = 2.3547213646862812
        theta_y = 3.091394193838764
        theta_z = -0.07102121943155337
    # apply u3 on q1
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q1))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))
    # apply cnot after u3 on q0
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

Wait, but in the QASM code, after the first u3 on q1, we have a cnot, then u3 on q0, then u3 on q1, then cnot, etc.

So in the Cirq code, after each u3 on q1, we add a cnot.

But in the code above, for each u3 on q1, after applying it, we add a cnot. So after the first u3 on q1, we add a cnot, then proceed to the next u3 on q0.

But in the QASM code, the order is:

u3(q0) → u3(q1) → cx → u3(q0) → u3(q1) → cx → u3(q0) → u3(q1) → cx.

Thus, in the Cirq code, after each pair of u3(q0) and u3(q1), we add a cx.

But in the current code structure, the cx is added after each u3 on q1.

So perhaps the code should have a loop where for each of the four u3 on q1, after applying u3, add the cnot, but also, after the u3 on q0, add the cnot.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to separate the processing of u3 on q0 and q1 with cnots in between.

But this is getting quite complex.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent each u3 gate as a custom gate, but that would require defining a custom two-qubit gate, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps using the built-in cirq.Circuit and composing the gates step by step.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to write the code as per the initial approach, making sure that each u3 on q0 and q1 is followed by a cnot.

But given the time, perhaps the code would be as follows:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()
circuit.initialize_state('00')

q0 = cirq.Qubit(0)
q1 = cirq.Qubit(1)

def apply_u3(theta_x, theta_y, theta_z, q):
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_z)(q))
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_y)(q))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q, q))
    circuit.append(cirq.CPhase(theta_x)(q))
    circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q, q))

# Apply u3 on q0
apply_u3(1.5705854245991118, -3.1667235621803993, -1.58730875641222e-05, q0)
# Apply u3 on q1
apply_u3(0.7864502280785407, 1.4997452219669574, 0.050219564359156976, q1)
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

# Repeat for the next set
apply_u3(0.050224804187928476, 0, pi, q0)
apply_u3(1.6418473665068425, -pi/2, pi, q1)
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

apply_u3(1.4956790561350626e-05, pi/2, pi, q0)
apply_u3(pi/2, pi/2, pi, q1)
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

apply_u3(1.5705854245991133, -3.1416085266773286, -0.02513090859065059, q0)
apply_u3(2.3547213646862812, 3.091394193838764, -0.07102121943155337, q1)
circuit.append(cirq.CNOT(q0, q1))

# Measure both qubits
circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q0, classical_reg('c1', 2)))
circuit.append(circuit.measurement(q1, c1))

Wait, no, the measurement part needs to be corrected. The classical register 'c1' should have two bits, so:

circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q0, c1[0]))
circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q1, c1[1]))

But in Cirq, you can't directly measure into a classical register; you have to create a classical state and assign the results.

So the correct way is:

# Measure both qubits
result0 = cirq.NamedQubit('c1', 0)
result1 = cirq.NamedQubit('c1', 1)
circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q0, result0))
circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q1, result1))

But in the code, the classical register is c1, so perhaps:

circuit.ancillas.append(cirq.ClassicalRegister(2, 'c1'))

Then:

circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q0, circuit.ancillas[-1][0]))
circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q1, circuit.ancillas[-1][1]))

But perhaps it's better to define the classical register first.

circuit.ancillas.append(cirq.ClassicalRegister(2, 'c1'))
circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q0, circuit.ancillas[-1][0]))
circuit.append(cirq.Measure(q1, circuit.ancillas[-1][1]))

Alternatively, using the results directly.

But perhaps the simplest way is to append the measurement operators.

But in any case, the full code would be quite long, and perhaps the user expects a code snippet that can be compiled.

But given the complexity, perhaps the code would be better structured with loops.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, and the u3 gates are controlled-U gates, but the code seems to be single-qubit operations.

Given the time constraints, I think I'll proceed with writing the Cirq code as per the initial approach, applying the necessary cphase and cnot operations for each u3 gate, followed by the cnot operations.
</think>

To convert the provided QASM code to Cirq, we'll break down each operation and represent them using Cirq's built-in gates. Here's the step-by-step conversion:

1. **Initialize the circuit** with two qubits in the state `|00⟩`.
2. **Apply each u3 gate** as a combination of `CPhase` and `CNOT` operations.
3. **Apply CNOT gates** where necessary between the qubits.
4. **Measure both qubits** at the end.

Here is the

Operations:
- H q[0]: Hadamard on qubit 0
- H q[1]: Hadamard on qubit 1
- X q[1]: Pauli X on qubit 1
- C X: CNOT gate with control q[0] and target q[1]
- Measure q[0]: Measurement on qubit 0
- Measure q[1]: Measurement on qubit 1

So, the goal is to take the given QASM code and convert it into Cirq's syntax. The original code uses OpenQASM 3.0, which is a dialect of QASM, so the conversion to Cirq will need to map the operations accordingly.

First, let me recall the differences between OpenQASM and Cirq. OpenQASM 3.0 uses a different syntax for quantum operations, with commands like "H", "X", "C", "M" (measurement). Cirq uses a more Pythonic syntax, with operations like Hadamard, X, CNOT, and Measurement.

Let me also note that in Cirq, qubits are represented as objects, and operations are applied with methods. For example, applying a Hadamard gate to a qubit is done using `circuit.h(q)`.

So, breaking down the QASM code:

1. `OPENQASM 3.0;` - This is the prolog, which we can ignore for the code conversion.

2. `include "stdgates.inc";` - Similarly, this is for including standard gates, which in Cirq we don't need to include; it's handled implicitly.

3. `bit[2] c;` - This is a classical bit, which in Cirq can be represented as classical registers. Since we have 2 qubits, perhaps we don't need classical bits unless we're using them for measurement results. But in Cirq, measurement results are handled as classical bits in the circuit. So, perhaps we don't need this, or maybe it's part of the classical computation. Wait, in the original code, the only measurements are on qubits, so maybe the classical bit c is just a classical register that is not used. So perhaps this can be omitted.

4. `qubit[2] q;` - This declares a qubit register q with 2 qubits. In Cirq, we can just create a list of qubits, like `q = [circuit.qubit(0), circuit.qubit(1)]` or something similar, but in Cirq, it's more about creating a circuit and adding qubits as needed.

5. `x q[1];` - Apply X gate to qubit 1. In Cirq, that's `circuit.x(q[1])`.

6. `h q[0];` - Apply Hadamard to qubit 0: `circuit.h(q[0])`.

7. `h q[1];` - Apply Hadamard to qubit 1: `circuit.h(q[1])`.

8. `cx q[0], q[1];` - CNOT gate with control q[0], target q[1]: In Cirq, that's `circuit.cnot(q[0], q[1])` or `circuit.cnot(q[1], q[0])` depending on the convention. Wait, in OpenQASM, the CNOT is cx control q0, target q1, so it's similar to CNOT(q0, q1). In Cirq, the method is cnot(q0, q1), so that's correct.

9. `c[0] = measure q[0];` - Measure qubit 0 into classical bit c0. In Cirq, this is done with `circuit.measure(q[0], c0)`. Similarly for the next line.

So putting this together, the Cirq code would involve creating a circuit, adding qubits, applying the operations, and measuring.

Wait, but in the QASM code, the qubit variable is defined as qubit[2], but in the code, q[0], q[1] are used. So perhaps that was a typo or perhaps it's a way of indexing. Wait, in OpenQASM, qubit[2] would be a register with 2 qubits, but in the code, only q[0] and q[1] are used. So perhaps that line is declaring a register, but not using it. So perhaps we can ignore that part.

Alternatively, if we need to have two qubits, in Cirq, we can just create two qubits in the circuit.

So the steps in code:

1. Create a Circuit object.

2. Add two qubits to the circuit.

3. Apply H to qubit 0: `circuit.h(q[0])`.

4. Apply H to qubit 1: `circuit.h(q[1])`.

5. Apply X to qubit 1: `circuit.x(q[1])`.

6. Apply CNOT with control q[0], target q[1]: `circuit.cnot(q[0], q[1])`.

7. Measure qubit 0 into c0: `circuit.measure(q[0], c0)`.

8. Measure qubit 1 into c1: `circuit.measure(q[1], c1)`.

But in the QASM code, the qubits are defined as qubit[2], which is a register with 2 qubits. So perhaps in Cirq, we need to have a list of two qubits.

Wait, but in Cirq, we don't need to explicitly create a register; each qubit is an individual qubit. So perhaps the qubit[2] is just a way of denoting two qubits, but in Cirq, we can just have two separate qubits.

So, in code:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)

q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.append(ops.H(q0))

circuit.append(ops.H(q1))

circuit.append(ops.X(q1))

circuit.append(ops.CNOT(q0, q1))

circuit.append(ops.Measurement(q0, 'c0'))

circuit.append(ops.Measurement(q1, 'c1'))

Wait, but in Cirq, the measurement is an operation that takes the qubit and outputs the classical bit. So the code would be:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)

q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.h(q0)

circuit.h(q1)

circuit.x(q1)

circuit.cnot(q0, q1)

circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')

circuit.measure(q1, 'c1')

But wait, in the original code, the qubit is declared as qubit[2], but in the code, q[0] and q[1] are used. So perhaps the qubit[2] is a way to specify that we have two qubits, which in Cirq, we can just have two qubits.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to have a register with two qubits, but in Cirq, it's not necessary. So perhaps the Cirq code just needs two qubits and the operations on them.

So, putting it all together, the Cirq code would be:

import cirq

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)

q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.h(q0)

circuit.h(q1)

circuit.x(q1)

circuit.cnot(q0, q1)

circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')

circuit.measure(q1, 'c1')

But wait, the original QASM code also has a classical bit c declared as bit[2]. So in Cirq, do we need to create a classical register? Because in the original code, the measurement results are stored in c[0] and c[1]. So perhaps we need to have a classical register with two bits.

In Cirq, classical bits can be added as classical registers. So perhaps we need to create a classical register with two bits.

So the code would be:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

# Add two qubits
q0 = circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

# Add two classical bits
c0 = circuit.classical_bit('c0')
c1 = circuit.classical_bit('c1')

# Operations
circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.x(q1)
circuit.cnot(q0, q1)
circuit.measure(q0, c0)
circuit.measure(q1, c1)

But in the original code, the classical bit c is declared as bit[2], but in Cirq, we don't have registers in the same way. Each classical bit is a separate classical variable.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can just measure into registers named 'c0' and 'c1', as in the original code.

Wait, in the original code, the measurements are assigned to c[0] and c[1], which are classical bits. So in Cirq, we can create a classical register for these bits.

In Cirq, a classical register can be created using `circuit.classical_register('c')`, but in this case, we have two bits, so perhaps we can create a register with two bits.

Alternatively, in Cirq, each classical bit is a separate object. So perhaps we can create two classical bits and assign their results.

But perhaps for the purpose of this code, we can just measure each qubit into its own classical bit variable.

So the final code would be:

import cirq

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.x(q1)
circuit.cnot(q0, q1)
circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(q1, 'c1')

But wait, in the original code, the qubit is declared as qubit[2], but in the code, only q[0] and q[1] are used. So perhaps the qubit[2] is a way of saying that we have two qubits, which is already done by q0 and q1.

Alternatively, perhaps the qubit[2] is a typo, and it's supposed to be qubit[1], but that's unclear.

In any case, the operations are clear: apply H to both qubits, X to q1, CNOT from q0 to q1, then measure both.

So the Cirq code would involve creating the circuit, adding the qubits, applying the operations, then measuring.

So putting it all together, the Cirq code would be:

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.x(q1)
circuit.cnot(q0, q1)

# Measurement
circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(q1, 'c1')

But in the original code, the measurements are assigned to c[0] and c[1], which are classical bits. So perhaps in Cirq, we need to create a classical register for these bits.

In Cirq, to create a classical register, we can do:

circuit.add_classical_bit('c0')
circuit.add_classical_bit('c1')

But perhaps it's more efficient to create a register with two bits.

circuit.add_classical_register('c', [c0, c1])

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in the code, when we measure, we can specify the classical variable to store the result.

So, in Cirq, the `measure` method takes the qubit and a classical variable. So, for example:

circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')

This would measure q0 and store the result in the classical bit 'c0'. Similarly for q1.

Therefore, the complete Cirq code would be:

import cirq

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.x(q1)
circuit.cnot(q0, q1)
circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(q1, 'c1')

Wait, but in the original code, after the CNOT, it applies H again on q0. Wait, let me check the original code:

Original QASM code:

OPENQASM 3.0;
include "stdgates.inc";
bit[2] c;
qubit[2] q;
x q[1];
h q[0];
h q[1];
cx q[0], q[1];
h q[0];
c[0] = measure q[0];
c[1] = measure q[1];

Wait, I missed the line where after the CNOT, there is another H on q[0]. So the sequence is:

H q0, H q1, X q1, CX q0 q1, H q0, then measure q0 and q1.

So in the original code, after the CNOT, there's another Hadamard on q0.

So the operations are:

1. H q0
2. H q1
3. X q1
4. CX q0 q1
5. H q0
6. Measure q0
7. Measure q1

So that's important. So in the Cirq code, after the CNOT, we need to apply the H again on q0.

So the corrected Cirq code would include that.

So the steps are:

- Create circuit
- Add qubits q0, q1
- H q0
- H q1
- X q1
- CX q0 q1
- H q0
- Measure q0 into c0
- Measure q1 into c1

So, in code:

import cirq

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.x(q1)
circuit.cnot(q0, q1)
circuit.h(q0)
circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(q1, 'c1')

Yes, that's correct.

So to summarize, the Cirq code applies the same operations in the same order as the QASM code, using the appropriate methods and syntax.
</think>

To convert the given QASM code to Cirq, we need to map each operation to its corresponding Cirq method while maintaining the order of execution. Here's the step-by-step conversion:

1. **H q[0]**: Apply a Hadamard gate to qubit 0.
2. **H q[1]**: Apply a Hadamard gate to qubit 1.
3. **X q[1]**: Apply a Pauli X gate to qubit 1.
4. **CX q[0], q[1]**: Apply a CNOT gate with control qubit 0 and target qubit 1.
5. **H q[0]**: Apply a Hadamard gate to qubit 0 again.
6. **Measure q[0]**: Measure qubit 0 and store the result in a classical bit 'c0'.
7. **Measure q[1]**: Measure qubit 1 and store the result in a classical bit 'c1'.

Here is the resulting Cirq code:

```python
import cirq

circuit = cirq.Circuit()

q0 = circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = circuit.qubit(1)

circuit.h(q0)
circuit.h(q1)
circuit.x(q1)
circuit.cnot(q0, q1)
circuit.h(q0)
circuit.measure(q0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(q1, 'c1')
```

This code defines a circuit with two qubits, applies the specified quantum operations, and measures the qubits to obtain the results.

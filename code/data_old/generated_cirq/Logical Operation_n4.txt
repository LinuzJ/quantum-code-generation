The user mentioned that the provided QASM code is for a 4 qubit circuit. It starts with the initialization of a classical bit register (c) and qubit register (bits). Then, it applies Hadamard gates (h) on the first qubit. Next, it applies CNOT gates between adjacent qubits. Finally, it measures each qubit into the classical register c.

So, the steps are:
1. Initialize 4 qubits into a superposition of |0> and |1>.
2. Apply Hadamard on the first qubit.
3. Apply CNOT gates from qubit 0 to qubit 1, qubit 1 to qubit 2, and qubit 2 to qubit 3.
4. Measure each qubit into classical bits.

In Cirq, the standard way is to use the qircuit module. So the code would start with:

from qubit import Quantum Circuit, Classical

circuit = Circuit(4)
c = Classical register (4)

Then define the operations:

- Apply Hadamard (H) on qubit 0.
- Apply CNOT (controlled by qubit i, target qubit i+1) for i from 0 to 2.
- Measure each qubit into c.

Putting all together:

circuit = Circuit(4)
c = Classical.register(circuit, 'c')

# Step 1: Initialize qubits as |+> state
for i in range(4):
    circuit.h(qubit i)

# Step 2: Apply CNOT from qubit 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3
for i in range(3):
    circuit.cnot(i, i+1)

# Step 3: Measure each qubit
for i in range(4):
    circuit.measure(i, c[i])

Wait, in Cirq, the measure function only takes one qubit and one classical variable. So for each i, we need to measure qubit i and store it in c[i]. But c is a register of classical variables. So, the correct way is to create a Classical.register with 4 variables, then for each qubit i, measure into c[i].

Alternatively, in Cirq, you can use c = Classical.register(circuit, 'c') then for each qubit, measure into it.

But perhaps the exact syntax would be:

circuit = Circuit(4)
c = Classical.register(circuit, 'c')

circuit.h(0)
circuit.cnot(0,1)
circuit.cnot(1,2)
circuit.cnot(2,3)
circuit.measure(0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(1, 'c1')
circuit.measure(2, 'c2')
circuit.measure(3, 'c3')

But in Cirq, the measure function expects the qubit and the classical variable name, and it automatically registers them.

So the final code should include all these steps.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct and syntactically correct.

Let me check:

In Cirq, the Circuit is created with the number of qubits. Then, the Classical.register is added with the circuit and the register name. Then, each operation is applied.

So, the code would look like:

from qubit import Circuit, Classical

circuit = Circuit(4)
c = Classical.register(circuit, 'c')

circuit.h(0)
circuit.cnot(0,1)
circuit.cnot(1,2)
circuit.cnot(2,3)
circuit.measure(0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(1, 'c1')
circuit.measure(2, 'c2')
circuit.measure(3, 'c3')

But perhaps in Cirq, the cnot is defined as cnot(i, j) which controls i and targets j. So in the code, it should be correct.

Wait, but in the original QASM code, the Hadamard is applied only to the first qubit. Then, CNOT is applied from bits[0] to bits[1], etc., meaning each qubit is the control for the next one. So in Cirq, this is exactly what the cnot operations do.

So, the steps are:

1. Initialize all qubits in the |+> state.
2. Apply CNOT from qubit 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3.
3. Measure all qubits into c.

Thus, the code as above should correctly translate the QASM code.

I think that should be the correct Cirq code.

To convert the provided QASM code into Cirq, we follow the steps outlined in the description. The QASM code initializes four qubits in a superposition state, applies a Hadamard gate, several CNOT gates, and then measures each qubit. The corresponding Cirq code initializes the circuit, applies the same gates, and measures each qubit into a classical register.

Here is the Cirq code:

```python
from qubit import Circuit, Classical

circuit = Circuit(4)
c = Classical.register(circuit, 'c')

circuit.h(0)
circuit.cnot(0, 1)
circuit.cnot(1, 2)
circuit.cnot(2, 3)
circuit.measure(0, 'c0')
circuit.measure(1, 'c1')
circuit.measure(2, 'c2')
circuit.measure(3, 'c3')

 qubits in use, but only q0, q1, q2 are defined as qubits. Other qubits are auxiliary, so they shouldn't be used as qubits in final code.

Wait, but in the Qasm code, qubits 1,5,1 are used? Wait, qubit 1 is defined twice. Maybe that's a mistake.

Looking back, in the original Qasm code, the qubits are:

qubit[1] q0;

qubit[5] q1;

qubit[1] q2;

So q0 is qubit[1], q1 is qubit[5], q2 is qubit[1]. That seems a bit confusing. Maybe a typo.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in defining qubits. It's unusual to reuse the same qubit index for different qubits. So perhaps it's supposed to be qubit[1], qubit[5], qubit[2], or something else.

Alternatively, maybe qubit[1] is used twice, but that would imply entangling the same qubit, which is possible but non-standard. It's unclear, but for the purposes of converting, perhaps we can treat q0, q1, q2 as distinct and adjust the qubit indices accordingly.

Assuming that q0 is qubit 1, q1 is qubit 5, and q2 is qubit 2. So that the indices are unique: q0 = qubit 1, q1 = qubit5, q2 = qubit2.

Alternatively, maybe the initial definitions are a mistake, but since the user specified the description, perhaps we can proceed with that.

So in the Cirq code, we can define:

q0 = qubit(1)
q1 = qubit(5)
q2 = qubit(2)

But in the Qasm code, qubit[1] is used twice, which suggests that the same physical qubit is being used as q0 and q2. That would require qubit[1] to be first used as q0, then as q2, but that would mean that q0 is entangled with itself, which is impossible. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and q2 should be a different qubit, like qubit[2]. Therefore, in Cirq code, we can have q0, q1, q2 as distinct qubits.

Now, looking at the Qasm code, after the initial definitions, the operations are applied to q0[0], q1[0], etc., which suggests that these are single-qubit operations. So when converting, each qubit is represented as a separate qubit in Cirq.

Additionally, the final measurements are on q0[0], q1[0], q1[1], etc. Wait, but q0, q1, q2 are individual qubits, so their indices are 0,0? No, in Qasm, q0[0] is the first qubit of q0, but in Cirq, qubits are represented as objects. So perhaps each qubit is a separate object in Cirq, so q0 is qubit 1, q1 is qubit5, q2 is qubit2, and each operation like rz applies to their respective qubit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's break it down step by step.

1. The Qasm code defines:
   - bit[7] meas;
   - qubit[1] q0;
   - qubit[5] q1;
   - qubit[1] q2;

This seems odd because qubit[1] is defined twice, which would imply that q0 and q2 are the same physical qubit, which is not allowed because you can't entangle a qubit with itself.

So perhaps this is a mistake in the Qasm code, and the intended definitions are:

qubit[1] q0;

qubit[5] q1;

qubit[2] q2;

Assuming that, we can proceed.

Therefore, in Cirq, we have q0, q1, q2 as distinct qubits.

2. The operations in Qasm are all single-qubit operations, except for cx which is a controlled-X between two qubits. So in Cirq, we need to represent these operations.

Looking at the operations, many of them are rotations (rz, ry, rx) and some are barriers (which are not present in Cirq, so they can be ignored). The cx operations are between q1 and q0, or q1 and q2, etc.

So for each operation, we can map it to Cirq's equivalent.

For example, rz(-pi/4) q0[0] becomes rotate_z(-pi/4) on q0.

Similarly, ry(pi) q0[0] becomes rotate_y(pi) on q0.

The cx q1[0], q0[0] becomes controlled_X(q1, q0).

3. The final measurements are on q0[0], q1[0], q1[1], q1[2], q1[3], q1[4], q2[0]. Wait, but if q0 is qubit1, q1 is qubit5, q2 is qubit2, then q1's indices 0,1,2,3,4 would be the different qubits, but in reality, q1 is a single qubit. So perhaps in Qasm, the indices are indicating something else.

Wait, perhaps in Qasm, the notation q1[0] refers to the first qubit of the q1 register. But in this case, the code is using multiple qubits, but the registers are not specified, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the indices are arbitrary and the code is using multiple qubits as part of the algorithm. So when converting, each q1[0], q1[1], etc., refers to different qubits.

But in the original Qasm code, the qubits are defined as qubit[1] q0; qubit[5] q1; qubit[1] q2; which is conflicting.

This suggests that perhaps the qubit indices in the Qasm code are arbitrary and not tied to the physical qubits. So when converting to Cirq, each qubit in the Qasm code (like q0, q1, q2) should correspond to distinct Cirq qubits.

So the plan is:

- Map each qubit in the Qasm code (q0, q1, q2) to distinct Cirq qubits.

- Ignore the barrier commands as they are not present in Cirq.

- For each operation, apply the corresponding Cirq gate on the respective qubits.

For example, rz(-pi/4) q0[0] → Cirq's RotateZ(-pi/4) on q0.

Similarly, cx q1[0], q0[0] → Cirq's ControlledX(q1, q0).

The final measurements are on q0[0], q1[0], q1[1], q1[2], q1[3], q1[4], q2[0]. Again, assuming that each index refers to a separate qubit, but in reality, each qubit is a single physical qubit, so perhaps in Qasm, the indices are indicating different qubits, but that's not the case. Wait, no, in Qasm, q1[0] is the first qubit of the q1 register, but in this code, it's not clear whether multiple qubits are being used.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to treat each occurrence of q0, q1, q2 as separate qubits in Cirq, and ignore the indices.

Wait, but looking at the Qasm code, the operations are applied to q0[0], q1[0], etc. So perhaps each [k] index refers to a different qubit in the same register. But in the given code, each q0, q1, q2 are single qubits, so q0[0] is the first qubit of q0's register, which is itself a single qubit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. In Qasm, the notation q0[0] refers to the first qubit in the q0 register, but if q0 is a single qubit, then q0[0] is q0 itself. So perhaps the indices are not indicating multiple qubits but are part of the gate's operation.

But in the given code, it's unclear. Given that, perhaps the safest way is to treat each q0, q1, q2 as a single qubit and apply each operation to that qubit.

But given that the HHL algorithm is being used, which typically requires multiple qubits, perhaps the code is using multiple qubits for the algorithm, with q0, q1, q2 being the main ones, and other qubits as ancillas.

Therefore, in Cirq, we can define the main qubits as q0, q1, q2, and others as auxiliary.

Looking back, the Qasm code uses qubits 1,5,1 as q0, q1, q2, but since qubit 1 is used twice, perhaps it's a mistake. So perhaps the intended qubit indices are 1,5,2.

So in Cirq, we can define:

q0 = qubit(1)
q1 = qubit(5)
q2 = qubit(2)

Then, each operation on q0[0] is applied to q0, same for q1[0], q1[1], etc.

But wait, the operations in Qasm are on q0[0], q1[0], etc., which suggests that each qubit is a register of multiple qubits, which is not the case. So perhaps the indices are indicating something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the indices are not indicating different qubits but are part of the gate parameters, such as which qubit to apply the gate to. But that's not standard in Qasm.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, and the indices are meant to indicate something else, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to write the Cirq code using the main qubits q0, q1, q2, ignoring the indices, and apply each gate to the respective qubit.

So the steps are:

1. Ignore the bit[7] meas; line as it's a measurement register, not part of the circuit.

2. Define the qubits as q0, q1, q2, which are the main qubits.

3. For each gate in the Qasm code, apply the corresponding Cirq gate to the respective qubit.

For example:

- rz(-pi/4) q0[0] → RotateZ(-pi/4) q0
- cx q1[0], q0[0] → ControlledX(q1, q0)
- And so on.

But wait, the indices in Qasm might be referring to multiple qubits, but without more context, it's unclear. However, given that the problem states that the final code should only use q0, q1, q2 as the qubits, and others as auxiliaries, perhaps the indices can be ignored, and each gate is applied to q0, q1, q2 as needed.

Looking at the Qasm code, the operations are applied to q0[0], q1[0], etc. Since the problem statement says that only q0, q1, q2 are the main qubits, perhaps the indices are not relevant, and each operation is applied to the corresponding qubit.

Therefore, in Cirq, the code would be:

Define q0, q1, q2 as qubits.

For each line, apply the gate to the corresponding qubit.

For example:

- rz(-pi/4) q0 → Cirq's RotateZ(-pi/4) on q0
- ry(pi) q0 → Cirq's RotateY(pi) on q0
- cx(q1, q0) → Cirq's ControlledX(q1, q0)
- And so on.

But looking at the code, after the initial definitions, there are multiple operations, some of which are on q0, some on q1, and some on q2.

Therefore, the Cirq code will involve applying a sequence of gates on q0, q1, q2.

The final measurements are on q0, q1[0], q1[1], etc. But since in Cirq, each qubit is a single entity, the measurements would be on q0, q1, q2, etc., but given that the problem states that only q0, q1, q2 are used, and others are auxiliaries, the measurements on q1[0], q1[1], etc., would correspond to the same qubit, which is not allowed.

This suggests that perhaps the indices are part of the gate application, but in reality, each index refers to a different qubit. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best way is to convert each occurrence of q0, q1, q2 in the Qasm code to the corresponding Cirq qubit, ignoring the indices, and apply each gate to the respective qubit.

But looking at the code, the operations are on q0, q1, q2, and their indices. It's possible that the indices are not relevant and each operation is applied to the same qubit.

Alternatively, perhaps the indices are indicating qubit registers, but without knowing the circuit structure, it's hard to tell.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed by writing the Cirq code, mapping each q0, q1, q2 to the respective Cirq qubits, and apply each gate to them.

So, the Cirq code would start by defining the qubits:

q0 = qubit(1)
q1 = qubit(5)
q2 = qubit(2)

Then, for each operation in the Qasm code, apply the corresponding gate.

For example:

- rz(-pi/4) q0[0] → Cirq's RotateZ(-pi/4) on q0
- ry(pi) q0[0] → Cirq's RotateY(pi) on q0
- cx(q1, q0) → Cirq's ControlledX(q1, q0)
- And so on.

But wait, looking at the Qasm code, after the initial definitions, the gates are:

rz(-pi/4) q0[0];
ry(pi) q0[0];
rz(pi/4) q0[0];
rx(3.8098602) q1[0];
ry(-pi/2) q1[0];
cx q1[0], q0[0];
...

So, each line applies a gate to a qubit, which can be either q0, q1, or q2, with their indices.

But in Cirq, each qubit is a single entity, so applying a gate to q0[0] would be the same as applying it to q0.

Therefore, the indices can be ignored, and each gate is applied to the corresponding qubit.

Thus, the Cirq code would be:

q0 = qubit(1)
q1 = qubit(5)
q2 = qubit(2)

for each operation in the Qasm code:
    apply the corresponding Cirq gate to the target qubit

For example:

- rz(-pi/4) on q0
- ry(pi) on q0
- rz(pi/4) on q0
- rx(3.8098602) on q1
- ry(-pi/2) on q1
- cx on q1, q0
- etc.

But the Qasm code has multiple operations on q0, q1, q2, including some controlled-X operations.

Therefore, the Cirq code will involve a sequence of these gates.

Finally, the measurements are on q0[0], q1[0], etc., but in Cirq, each qubit is measured once, so the measurements would be on q0, q1, q2.

But in the Qasm code, the measurements are on multiple qubits, which suggests that the circuit involves multiple qubits being measured, possibly as part of the algorithm.

Given that, the Cirq code will have measurements on q0, q1, q2, and possibly others, but according to the problem statement, only q0, q1, q2 are the main qubits, so the measurements would be on these.

Putting it all together, the Cirq code would define q0, q1, q2 as qubits and apply the sequence of gates from the Qasm code to them, followed by measurements on all three.

However, looking at the Qasm code, there are multiple operations on q1 and q2 as well, suggesting that they are also part of the circuit.

But the problem statement mentions that the final code should only use q0, q1, q2, and others as auxiliaries. Therefore, the main qubits are q0, q1, q2, and the auxiliaries are used for intermediate steps but not measured.

But the measurements in Qasm are on q0, q1[0], q1[1], etc., which suggests that multiple qubits are being measured. So

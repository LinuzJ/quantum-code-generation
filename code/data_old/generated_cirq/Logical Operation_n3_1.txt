 qubits.

Wait, but the QASM code has bit[3] c; and qubit[3] q;. So maybe there are 4 qubits? Hmm, no, probably c is a classical bit, and q is a qubit register. So, qubits are q[0], q[1], q[2].

So, 3 qubits.

In the QASM code, the operations are:

x q[0];  // X gate on qubit 0
x q[1];  // X gate on qubit 1
cx q[2], q[1]; // CNOT(q2, q1)
cx q[0], q[1]; // CNOT(q0, q1)
h q[2]; // Hadamard on q2
t q[0]; // T gate on q0
tdg q[1]; // Tdg gate on q1
t q[2]; // T gate on q2
cx q[2], q[1]; // CNOT(q2, q1)
cx q[0], q[2]; // CNOT(q0, q2)
t q[1]; // T gate on q1
cx q[0], q[1]; // CNOT(q0, q1)
tdg q[2]; // Tdg gate on q2
tdg q[1]; // Tdg gate on q1
cx q[0], q[2]; // CNOT(q0, q2)
cx q[2], q[1]; // CNOT(q2, q1)
t q[1]; // T gate on q1
h q[2]; // Hadamard on q2
cx q[2], q[1]; // CNOT(q2, q1)
c[0] = measure q[0]; // Measure q0 into classical c0
c[1] = measure q[1]; // Measure q1 into classical c1
c[2] = measure q[2]; // Measure q2 into classical c2

So, the goal is to convert all of these operations into Cirq operations.

First, let's figure out the structure. Since the circuit ends with measurements of all qubits, it seems like this is a quantum circuit that doesn't use any entanglement after all measurements.

Wait, but to have measurements, the qubits have to be entangled. So, I need to figure out the correct way to apply gates to create the desired entanglement.

Let me list all the operations:

1. X q[0] → apply X to q0
2. X q[1] → apply X to q1
3. cx q[2], q[1] → CNOT with control q2, target q1
4. cx q[0], q[1] → CNOT with control q0, target q1
5. h q[2] → Hadamard on q2
6. t q[0] → T gate on q0
7. tdg q[1] → Tdg gate on q1
8. t q[2] → T gate on q2
9. cx q[2], q[1] → CNOT(q2, q1)
10. cx q[0], q[2] → CNOT(q0, q2)
11. t q[1] → T gate on q1
12. cx q[0], q[1] → CNOT(q0, q1)
13. tdg q[2] → Tdg on q2
14. tdg q[1] → Tdg on q1
15. cx q[0], q[2] → CNOT(q0, q2)
16. cx q[2], q[1] → CNOT(q2, q1)
17. t q[1] → T gate on q1
18. h q[2] → Hadamard on q2
19. cx q[2], q[1] → CNOT(q2, q1)
20. c[0] = measure q[0] → measure q0 into c0
21. c[1] = measure q[1] → measure q1 into c1
22. c[2] = measure q[2] → measure q2 into c2

So, 22 operations. Let's see how to translate these into Cirq.

First, in Cirq, the standard gates are defined with the qubits as arguments. So:

- X gates: cirq.X(q0), cirq.X(q1)
- CNOT: cirq.CNOT(q2, q1) etc.
- Hadamard: cirq.H
- T: cirq.T
- Tdg: cirq.Tdg

Now, in the code, I need to write these operations in the correct order.

Let me start writing:

1. cirq.X(q[0])
2. cirq.X(q[1])
3. cirq.CNOT(q[2], q[1])
4. cirq.CNOT(q[0], q[1])
5. cirq.H(q[2])
6. cirq.T(q[0])
7. cirq.Tdg(q[1])
8. cirq.T(q[2])
9. cirq.CNOT(q[2], q[1])
10. cirq.CNOT(q[0], q[2])
11. cirq.T(q[1])
12. cirq.CNOT(q[0], q[1])
13. cirq.Tdg(q[2])
14. cirq.Tdg(q[1])
15. cirq.CNOT(q[0], q[2])
16. cirq.CNOT(q[2], q[1])
17. cirq.T(q[1])
18. cirq.H(q[2])
19. cirq.CNOT(q[2], q[1])

So, the Cirq code will be a list of these operations.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the order and that the qubits are correctly numbered. In Cirq, qubits are 0-indexed, which they already are in the QASM code.

So, for example, in the QASM code, the qubits are q[0], q[1], q[2], which correspond to the first, second, and third qubits, so in Cirq, we can just use q0, q1, q2.

Therefore, in the Cirq code, the operations would be:

op = [
    cirq.X(q0),
    cirq.X(q1),
    cirq.CNOT(q2, q1),
    cirq.CNOT(q0, q1),
    cirq.H(q2),
    cirq.T(q0),
    cirq.Tdg(q1),
    cirq.T(q2),
    cirq.CNOT(q2, q1),
    cirq.CNOT(q0, q2),
    cirq.T(q1),
    cirq.CNOT(q0, q1),
    cirq.Tdg(q2),
    cirq.Tdg(q1),
    cirq.CNOT(q0, q2),
    cirq.CNOT(q2, q1),
    cirq.T(q1),
    cirq.H(q2),
    cirq.CNOT(q2, q1),
]

Wait, but that seems a lot, and I have to make sure the operations are in the correct order. Let me double-check.

Looking at the QASM code:

After x q0, x q1, CNOT q2 q1, CNOT q0 q1, H q2, T q0, Tdg q1, T q2, then another CNOT q2 q1, CNOT q0 q2, T q1, CNOT q0 q1, Tdg q2, Tdg q1, CNOT q0 q2, CNOT q2 q1, T q1, H q2, CNOT q2 q1.

Wait, perhaps the operations can be simplified because some are repeated. For example, multiple CNOT(q2, q1) or CNOT(q0, q1).

Alternatively, maybe some operations can be grouped or combined. But since the goal is to just translate each line, I think we have to include all operations as they are.

Wait, but when you have a series of gates, they are applied in sequence. So, the order is important. Let me make sure I list all operations in the same order as the QASM code.

Yes, so the Cirq code would be a list of all these operations.

Additionally, in the QASM code, after all the gate operations, we have measurements, which in Cirq would be qubit measurements.

So, the code would be:

from cirq import CNOT, X, H, T, Tdg

q0 = cirq.Qubit(0)
q1 = cirq.Qubit(1)
q2 = cirq.Qubit(2)

operations = [
    X(q0),
    X(q1),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    H(q2),
    T(q0),
    Tdg(q1),
    T(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    T(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    Tdg(q2),
    Tdg(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    T(q1),
    H(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
]

Then, after all operations, we have to apply measurements.

In Cirq, measurements are done using the measurement operator. The classical variables can be captured by applying the measurement and then using the classical results.

But since the code ends with c[0] = measure q[0], etc., perhaps in Cirq, we need to apply the measurement to each qubit.

So, the complete Cirq code would include the operations and then the measurements.

But wait, in the QASM code, after all the gates, the measurements are performed on q0, q1, q2, which are then assigned to classical registers.

In Cirq, measurements are done using the Measure() function. However, since the circuit ends with measurements, the operations before the measurements can be considered the quantum part.

So, putting it all together, the Cirq code would be:

from cirq import CNOT, X, H, T, Tdg, Measure

q0 = cirq.Qubit(0)
q1 = cirq.Qubit(1)
q2 = cirq.Qubit(2)

# Quantum operations
operations = [
    X(q0),
    X(q1),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    H(q2),
    T(q0),
    Tdg(q1),
    T(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    T(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    Tdg(q2),
    Tdg(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    T(q1),
    H(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
]

# Classical measurements
c0 = Measure(q0)
c1 = Measure(q1)
c2 = Measure(q2)

# Compile the circuit
circuit = cirq.CompiledCircuit(operations + [c0, c1, c2])

But wait, in Cirq, you can't just add measurements to the operations list because they are not quantum operations. So, I think I need to create a circuit with the quantum operations and then perform measurements on the qubits.

Alternatively, the correct way is to create a circuit with the quantum operations and then perform measurements on each qubit.

So, in code, it would be:

from cirq import Circuit

circuit = Circuit(q0, q1, q2)
circuit.add_operations(operations)
c0 = circuit.measure(q0)
c1 = circuit.measure(q1)
c2 = circuit.measure(q2)

But wait, in the QASM code, all measurements are done after all operations, which is correct.

So, in the Cirq code, after defining the quantum operations, we can perform the measurements.

Therefore, the complete Cirq code is:

from cirq import Circuit, X, CNOT, H, T, Tdg

q0 = Circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = Circuit.qubit(1)
q2 = Circuit.qubit(2)

# Quantum operations
circuit = Circuit(q0, q1, q2)
circuit.add_operation(X(q0))
circuit.add_operation(X(q1))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q2, q1))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q0, q1))
circuit.add_operation(H(q2))
circuit.add_operation(T(q0))
circuit.add_operation(Tdg(q1))
circuit.add_operation(T(q2))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q2, q1))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q0, q2))
circuit.add_operation(T(q1))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q0, q1))
circuit.add_operation(Tdg(q2))
circuit.add_operation(Tdg(q1))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q0, q2))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q2, q1))
circuit.add_operation(T(q1))
circuit.add_operation(H(q2))
circuit.add_operation(CNOT(q2, q1))

# Classical measurements
c0 = circuit.measure(q0)
c1 = circuit.measure(q1)
c2 = circuit.measure(q2)

So, this should compile correctly.

Wait, but in Cirq, when you use Circuit.add_operation, you can also add multiple operations in a list.

Alternatively, to make it cleaner, perhaps use a list and then add_all_operations.

But in the code, adding each operation individually is fine, though a bit tedious.

Alternatively, create a list of operations and add them all at once.

So, perhaps:

operations = [
    X(q0),
    X(q1),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    H(q2),
    T(q0),
    Tdg(q1),
    T(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    T(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    Tdg(q2),
    Tdg(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    T(q1),
    H(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
]

circuit = Circuit(q0, q1, q2)
circuit.add_operations(operations)
c0 = circuit.measure(q0)
c1 = circuit.measure(q1)
c2 = circuit.measure(q2)

This is more efficient.

Therefore, the final code is as above.

Wait, but in the QASM code, the last operation before measurement is:

cx q[2], q[1];

Which is a CNOT(q2, q1). So, in the Cirq code, I have included that as the last quantum operation.

Then, the measurements are added.

So, the complete Cirq code is:

from cirq import Circuit, X, CNOT, H, T, Tdg

q0 = Circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = Circuit.qubit(1)
q2 = Circuit.qubit(2)

operations = [
    X(q0),
    X(q1),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    H(q2),
    T(q0),
    Tdg(q1),
    T(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    T(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    Tdg(q2),
    Tdg(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    T(q1),
    H(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
]

circuit = Circuit(q0, q1, q2)
circuit.add_operations(operations)
c0 = circuit.measure(q0)
c1 = circuit.measure(q1)
c2 = circuit.measure(q2)

But wait, in the QASM code, the first two operations are X q0 and X q1, which are applied to q0 and q1, respectively. Then, CNOT(q2, q1), which is a controlled-not with q2 as control and q1 as target. Then CNOT(q0, q1), which is a controlled-not with q0 as control and q1 as target.

After that, H(q2), T(q0), Tdg(q1), T(q2), and so on.

Yes, all operations are correctly included.

So, the Cirq code should compile correctly without any errors.

I think that's the correct translation.
</think>

To convert the provided QASM code to Cirq, we need to carefully map each QASM operation to its corresponding Cirq gate and ensure the operations are applied in the correct order. Here's the step-by-step translation:

### QASM to Cirq Translation

1. **Identify Qubits and Gates:**
   - Qubits in QASM are `q[0]`, `q[1]`, `q[2]`, which correspond directly to `q0`, `q1`, `q2` in Cirq.
   - Gates include `X`, `CNOT`, `H`, `T`, and `Tdg`.

2. **List Operations in Order:**
   - Enumerate each gate operation from the QASM code and map them to Cirq gates.

3. **Write Cirq Code:**
   - Import necessary Cirq classes.
   - Define qubits using `Circuit.qubit()` method.
   - Create a `Circuit` object and add each operation from the translated list.
   - Perform measurements on each qubit to capture classical results.

### Cirq Code

```python
from cirq import Circuit, X, CNOT, H, T, Tdg

q0 = Circuit.qubit(0)
q1 = Circuit.qubit(1)
q2 = Circuit.qubit(2)

operations = [
    X(q0),
    X(q1),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    H(q2),
    T(q0),
    Tdg(q1),
    T(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    T(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q1),
    Tdg(q2),
    Tdg(q1),
    CNOT(q0, q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
    T(q1),
    H(q2),
    CNOT(q2, q1),
]

circuit = Circuit(q0, q1, q2)
circuit.add_operations(operations)
c0 = circuit.measure(q0)
c1 = circuit.measure(q1)
c2 = circuit.measure(q2)
```

### Explanation

1. **Imports and Definitions:**
   - `Circuit`, `X`, `CNOT`, `H`, `T`, `Tdg` are imported from the `cirq` module.
   - Qubits `q0`, `q1`, `q2` are defined using the `Circuit` class.

2. **Operations List:**
   - Each operation from the QASM code is converted into its Cirq equivalent and added to the `operations` list in the correct order.

3. **Circuit Setup:**
   - A `Circuit` object is created with the qubits `q0`, `q1`, `q2`.
   - Quantum operations are added to the circuit using `add_operations(operations)`.

4. **Measurements:**
   - Classical measurements are performed on each qubit to obtain results `c0`, `c1`, `c2`.

This Cirq code accurately translates the given QASM circuit, ensuring all operations are correctly applied and measurements are performed as specified.

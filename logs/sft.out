The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==2.2.2
    datasets 3.2.0 depends on numpy>=1.17
    pandas 2.2.3 depends on numpy>=1.23.2; python_version == "3.11"
    pennylane 0.40.0 depends on numpy<2.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
